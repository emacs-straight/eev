;;; Commentary:

;; Most of the _comments_ below are obsolete. The recommended way to
;; use this is now by running, for example,
;;
;;   (find-freenode-links "e" "#emacs")
;;
;; and then copying and pasting these lines to your .emacs:
;;
;;   (setq ee-freenode-ichannels "#eev #emacs")
;;   (setq ee-freenode-achannels "#eev #emacs")
;;   (defun e2 () (interactive) (find-freenode-2a "#emacs"))
;;   (defun e3 () (interactive) (find-freenode-3a "#emacs"))
;;
;; Then `M-x e3' creates the three-window setup described here,
;;
;;   (find-rcirc-intro "1. The server buffer and the channel buffers")
;;
;; that lets you follow all the steps of the connection. Once you're
;; sure that you're connected to the server you can use `M-x e2' to
;; create a two-window setup with just the current buffer and the
;; #emacs buffer.

;; OBSOLETE COMMENTS:
;;
;; Here we implement a very thin eev-ish layer on top of rcirc. The
;; main goal is:
;;
;;   instant gratification and irc-ing for late-night zombie-mode
;;   half-brain-dead hackers
;;
;; which, in practical terms, means the following. Suppose that we
;; want to ask something on the channel #foobar of Freenode; we run
;; `M-x find-freenode-links', adjust the intended channel name to
;; #foobar, and set `M-99j' and `M-9j' to the right hyperlinks. Then,
;; if we are in a buffer called "stuff", `M-99j' would create this
;; window setting:
;;
;;     _____________________
;;    |          |          |
;;    |          | freenode |
;;    |          |  server  |
;;    |  stuff   |  buffer  |
;;    |          |__________|
;;    |          |          |
;;    |          | #foobar  |
;;    |__________|__________|
;;
;; which is great for following in real-time the connection being
;; established - I find this essential for when it is very late at
;; night and I am half-brain-dead -, and `M-9j' just switches to the
;; buffer of the channel #foobar.

;; Conventions on arguments:
;; CHANNELS can be a list ("#foo" "#bar") or a string like "#foo #bar";
;; If CHANNEL is a string starting with "#", it is a channel to /join;
;; if CHANNEL is a string not starting with "#", it is a nick to /query;
;; if CHANNEL is nil, that means to use the server buffer.
