;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Sometime around 2015 I realized that I could make write a sandboxed
;; tutorial - (find-eev-quick-intro) - that could be THE starting
;; point of eev. It would be:
;;
;;   1) an interactive tutorial for beginners,
;;   2) the thing that emacs shows when it starts (when we invoke it
;;      as "~/eev"),
;;   3) a tutorial for advanced users,
;;   4) an index to the other sandboxed tutorials, that were mostly
;;      quite technical (and incomplete),
;;   5) a guide to the source files.
;;
;; As of jan/2019, the work to make (find-eev-quick-intro) central is
;; almost complete (...)
;;
;; To use this, simply execute any of the sexps below:
;;   (find-eev-quick-intro)

This buffer is _temporary_ and _editable_.
It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.
The quickest way to open or recreate this is with `M-5 M-j'.


This is a tutorial for real beginners.
It supposes that you have Emacs installed.
You may start by watching these (old) videos:

  http://angg.twu.net/eev-videos/video-eev-quick-0.mp4  (installation basics)
  http://angg.twu.net/eev-videos/video4-eepitch.mp4     (eev's main ideas)




1. Installing eev
=================
Open the page at

  http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html

in a browser, and open a terminal running a shell. Mark the multi-line
\"{ ... }\" block below, copy it to the clipboard with ctrl-C, and paste
it into the shell to run its commands.

{
  rm -Rv ~/eev
  rm -Rv ~/eev2/
  mkdir  ~/eev2/
  cd     ~/eev2/
  rm -fv eev2.tgz
  wget http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/eev2.tgz
  tar -xvzf eev2.tgz
  {
    echo '#!/bin/sh'
    echo 'cd ~/eev2/ && emacs -l eev-beginner.el --eval=\"(find-eev-quick-intro)\" $*'
  } > ~/eev
  chmod 755 ~/eev
}

You now have a shell script that you can invoke with

  ~/eev

that starts Emacs, loads eev, and opens a copy of this tutorial.

Every time that Emacs gets stuck into something that you don't know
how to leave, or how to undo, you should kill the Emacs window and
start it again by typing \"~/eev\" again in the shell prompt.

Eventually you will learn how go get out of everything and how to undo
almost anything, _BUT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN IN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES_.
This tutorial is intented to make you learn the most essential things
in the first ten minutes - including how to navigate in Emacs's
manuals.

For more on ways to install eev see:

  (find-eev-install-intro)




2. Evaluating Lisp
==================
The most important idea in Emacs is that Lisp code can appear
anywhere, and you can evaluate a Lisp expression (a \"sexp\") by
placing the cursor (the \"point\") just after it and typing `C-x
C-e'; the result is then displayed in the echo area.

Note: `C-e' means control-E, `M-e' means alt-e, `M-E' means
alt-shift-e. If you have Caps Lock on then Emacs will receive an `M-E'
if you type alt-e, and `M-e' if you type alt-shift-e. Hint: avoid Caps
Lock!

You can try `C-x C-e' in the line below, with the point in the three
different indicated positions - you should get different results...

  (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))
            ^       ^^
            |       | \\
            6      20  26

...but `C-x C-e' is not beginner-friendly, and it even enters a
debugger that is hard to leave if it finds errors, so let's see
something better.

When you type `M-e' emacs moves the point to the end of the
current line, then runs a variant of `C-x C-e'. Try this on each
line of the block below:

  (+ (* 2 3)
     (* 4 5)
     )

`M-e' accepts several different numeric prefixes that alter its
behavior. We are only interested in one of them now - `M-0 M-e'
highlights the sexp for a fraction of a second insted of executing it.
Try it above.




3. Elisp hyperlinks
===================
Each one of the sexps below makes Emacs \"go somewhere\" if you execute
it with `M-e'. Executing sexps like those - we will call them \"elisp
hyperlinks\" - is like following a hyperlink in a browser.

In a browser you can \"go back\" after following a hyperlink because the
previous page is kept in the memory somehow. In Emacs+eev the easiest
way to \"go back\" is with `M-k', which runs a function called
`ee-kill-this-buffer'. If you follow one of the links below with
`M-e', it creates a new buffer and displays it. If you then type `M-k'
this new buffer is killed, and Emacs displays the buffer that was just
below it, which is this tutorial... try it! Here are some nice elisp
hyperlinks:

  (find-fline \"/tmp/\")
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)
  (find-man \"date\")
  (find-sh  \"date; sleep 1; date\")

Not all elisp hyperlinks \"go somewhere\"; some are like buttons that
perform an action, like the one below, that acts as if the user had
pressed a series of keys,

  (eek \"<down> C-a H E L L O ! <up> C-e\")

and some display their output in the echo area:

  (find-sh0 \"date\")

The following elisp hyperlinks may or may not work - try them too, but
be aware that they may show errors instead of opening a new buffer.
The first two of them open a page - actually a section, whose short
title is \"Lisp Eval\" - from the main Emacs manual. The third one
opens the file with the source code (in Lisp) for the function
`find-file'.

  (find-node \"(emacs)Lisp Eval\")
  (find-enode       \"Lisp Eval\")
  (find-efunction 'find-file)

If they don't work that means that you don't have the Emacs manuals,
or the elisp source files, installed. The names for the packages which
have those things vary from one GNU/Linux distro to another. On Debian
something like

  sudo apt-get install emacs24-el
  sudo apt-get install emacs24-common-non-dfsg

or

  sudo apt-get install emacs-el
  sudo apt-get install emacs-common-non-dfsg

may work - but for \"...-non-dfsg\" packages may need you to
enable access to the \"non-free\" respository... ask for help if
you need!

An important difference between elisp hyperlinks and browser
hyperlinks is discussed here:

  (find-links-conv-intro \"1. Security vs. transparency\")




3.1. Non-elisp hyperlinks
-------------------------
Emacs has ways to follow URLs, but the keys for that are totally
different from the ones for elisp hyperlinks. You can follow the URL
below by putting the point on it and typing `M-x browse-url':

  http://www.lua.org/start.html

This will make emacs invoke the default browser on that URL. See:

  (find-enode \"Browse-URL\")

Eev defines several functions similar to `browse-url'. These elisp
hyperlinks

  (find-firefox      \"http://www.lua.org/start.html\")
  (find-googlechrome \"http://www.lua.org/start.html\")

invoke \"firefox\" and \"google-chrome\" respectively on the given URL;
note that the \"firefox\" in a Debian-based system is usually a free
derivative of Firefox, and that \"google-chrome\" does not come
installed by default because it is \"gratis\" but not free. Also,

  M-x brff   -- runs `find-firefox' on the URL at point,
  M-x brg    -- runs `find-googlechrome' on the URL at point.

For more on the \"brxxx functions\" of eev, see:

  (find-brxxx-intro)





4. Creating Elisp Hyperlinks
============================
You can write elisp hyperlinks by hand, but that is hard. It is better
to generate hyperlinks automatically and then use cut and paste.

Eev has several functions that generate \"elisp hyperlinks\" buffers.
For example,

  (find-efunction-links 'find-file)

creates this buffer, and switches to it:
   ____________________________________________________________________ 
  |# (find-efunction-links 'find-file)                                 |
  |# (eek \"M-h M-f  find-file\")                                        |
  |# (find-eev-quick-intro \"4.2. `find-ekey-links' and  friends\")      |
  |                                                                    |
  |# (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)                                  |
  |# (find-efunction 'find-file)                                       |
  |# (find-efunctionpp 'find-file)                                     |
  |# (find-efunctiond 'find-file)                                      |
  |                                                                    |
  |# (Info-goto-emacs-command-node 'find-file)                         |
  |# (find-enode \"Command Index\" \"* find-file:\")                       |
  |# (find-elnode \"Index\" \"* find-file:\")                              |
  |                                                                    |
  |# (where-is 'find-file)                                             |

  |# (find-fline (symbol-file 'find-file 'defun))                      |
  |# (find-estring (documentation 'find-file))                         |
  |# (find-estring (documentation 'find-file t))                       |
  |# (describe-function 'find-file)                                    |

  |                                                                    |

4.1. `find-here-links'
----------------------
One standard way of using eev is:

  a) we keep our current notes in a a file - for example, \"~/TODO\"
  b) these notes are an \"executable log\" of what we did, including:
     c) hyperlinks to things we saw or visited
     d) commands issued to shells or shell-like programs (see sec. 6)

The quickest way of generating hyperlinks for (c) is with `M-h M-h'
\(`find-here-links'). When we type `M-h M-h' eev tries to generate an
elisp hyperlinks buffer containing some hyperlinks to \"here\" - and how
it does that depends on the major mode and on the name of the current
buffer. For example, typing `M-h M-h' here generates:

The elisp hyperlink

  # (find-eev-quick-intro)

at the end opens this tutorial.

The best way to learn how to create very quickly these
\"hyperlinks to things we saw or visited\" and to copy them to
our notes is explained in a separate tutorial:

  (find-here-links-intro)

Cutting and pasting is explained briefly in section 5.2, below.
A way to go quickly to \"~/TODO\" is explained in section 7.1.
A way to \"refine\" hyperlinks to make them more precise is
explained here:

  (find-refining-intro \"2. Refining hyperlinks\")




4.2. `find-ekey-links' and friends
----------------------------------
Emacs is huge and you will probably want to save in your notes
many links about keys and functions that look interesting - using
`M-2 M-j' from time to time to visit

  (find-emacs-keys-intro)

and learning the keys listed there will not be enough.

Try the eek links below:

  (eek \"M-h M-k  C-x 4 0\")
  (eek \"M-h M-k  C-x 4 0  ;; kill-buffer-and-window\")
  (eek \"M-h M-k  C-s\")
  (eek \"M-h M-k  C-s  ;; isearch-forward\")
  (eek \"M-h M-f  isearch-forward\")

  (eek \"M-h M-k  M-h M-k  ;; find-ekey-links\")
  (eek \"M-h M-k  M-h M-f  ;; find-efunction-links\")

You will notice that:

  1. they create temporary buffers with lots of elisp hyperlinks,

  2. you can \"go back\" from these buffers with `M-k',

  3. the function name after the \";;\" is a comment and is
     ignored by Emacs (but is useful for humans),

  4. you can copy these hyperlinks to your \"~/TODO\",

  5. the \"M-h M-k\" and \"M-h M-f\" in the beginning are
     reminders that we can use `M-h M-k <key-sequence>' and `M-h
     M-f <function-name>' to create help buffers about other keys
     and functions,

  6. some of the hyperlinks use low-level representations for key
     sequences - you don't need to understand them. An example:

       (find-ekey-links \"\\^X40\")

  7. for _some_ keys and functions, but not all, the hyperlinks
     like

       (Info-goto-emacs-key-command-node \"\\C-s\")
       (Info-goto-emacs-command-node 'isearch-forward)
       (find-enode \"Command Index\" \"* isearch-forward:\")
       (find-elnode \"Index\" \"* defun:\")

     that appear near the middle of the elisp hyperlinks buffers,
     point to relevant points in the Emacs manuals - see the next
     section.




5. Links to Emacs documentation
===============================
Try these links (some of them need the Emacs manuals installed):

  (find-emacs-keys-intro \"Cutting & pasting\")
  (find-node \"(emacs)Screen\")
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)
  (find-efunction-links 'find-file)

This part of the eev tutorials has links to almost all the keys that
I've learned by heart after using Emacs for 20 years:

  (find-emacs-intro \"Basic keys (Emacs)\")

They are not very many, because I use this a lot,

  (find-node \"(emacs)M-x\")

and I use elisp hyperlinks to create quick reminders for the keys that
I only need to remember when I am performing specific tasks.

Moral: when you want a quick reference of the main Emacs and eev keys,
type `M-2 M-j'.



5.1. Navigating the Emacs manuals
---------------------------------
The Emacs manuals are in \"info\" format, which means:

  a) they are divided into \"nodes\" - a top node, and chapters,
     sections, subsections, etc,

  b) the nodes in each manual in info format are organized as a tree,
     and they're all numbered except for the top node, the indexes and
     the appendixes. For example:

       top --.-- 1 --.-- 1.1
             |       `-- 1.2
             |-- 2
             |-- 3 ----- 3.1 --.-- 3.1.1
             |                 |-- 3.1.2
             |                 `-- 3.1.3
             |-- Appendix A 
             `-- Index

  c) each node has both a short name and a long name (its title),
     and they may be different. For example, the hyperlinks below

       (find-node \"(emacs)Intro\")
       (find-node \"(emacs)Screen\")

     point to nodes whose titles are \"Introduction\" and \"The
     Organization of the Screen\",

  d) each manual also has a short name, also called its
     _filename_, and several kinds of long names and titles. The
     `find-node' links use the filename in parenthesis followed
     by the short node name. For example:

       Manual title                       elisp hyperlink
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       GNU Emacs Manual                 (find-node \"(emacs)\"Top)
       Emacs Lisp / GNU Emacs Lisp
         Reference Manual               (find-node \"(elisp)\"Top)
       An Introduction to 
         Programming in Emacs Lisp      (find-node \"(eintr)\"Top)

  e) The \"Info directory\" lists all the installed info manuals.
     You can access it with:

       (find-node \"(dir)Top\")

     The main Emacs manuals appear grouped together there. Try:

       (find-node \"(dir)Top\" \"extensible self-documenting\")

     You will see something like this:

       Emacs
       * Emacs:               The extensible self-documenting text editor.
       * Emacs FAQ:           Frequently Asked Questions about Emacs.
       * Elisp:               The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.
       * Emacs Lisp Intro:    A simple introduction to Emacs Lisp 
                                programming.

  f) Emacs uses \"Info mode\" when displaying nodes of manuals in
     info format. In Info mode the tool bar displays icons
     meaning \"back\", \"forward\", \"previous\", \"next\",
     \"home\", etc, and you can click on these icons to navigate
     from the current node to other nodes. The main keys of Info
     mode are worth learning, though - the full list of keys can
     be found here,

       (find-efunctiondescr 'Info-mode)

     and the main ones are:

       q         exit             (go back to some other buffer) 
       (arrows)  move point
       RET       follow link at point
       TAB       move to next link
       BACKTAB   move to prev link
       u         move \"up\" from this node
       n         move to the \"next\" node of this node
       p         move to the \"previous\" node of this node
       [         go backward one node, considering all nodes as
                 forming one sequence
       ]         go forward one node, considering all nodes as
                 forming one sequence

       d         go to the Info directory node.
       l         move back in history to the last node you were at.
       r         move forward in history to the node you returned from
                 after using `l'
       L         go to menu of visited nodes
       T         go to table of contents of the current Info file

    Try the keys above now - if you execute the `eek' sexp below
    it will split the window, keep these instructions in the left
    window and open and Info buffer at the right.

      (eek \"<down> M-3 M-e  ;; open the hyperlink below in the right window\")
      (find-node \"(emacs)Basic\")
      (find-node \"(emacs)Major Modes\")



5.2. Cutting and pasting
------------------------
You can do cut, copy and paste in a \"user-friendly\" way by using

  a) the rightmost icons in the toolbar, or
  b) the \"Edit\" menu in the menu-bar,

but the keys are very much worth learning:

  C-SPC   -- set-mark-command           (find-enode \"Setting Mark\")
  C-x C-x -- exchange-point-and-mark    (find-enode \"Setting Mark\" \"C-x C-x\")
  C-w     -- kill-region     (cut)      (find-enode \"Other Kill Commands\")
  M-w     -- kill-ring-save  (copy)     (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")
  C-y     -- yank            (paste)    (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")

The \"region\" where cut & paste operate is always what is between
the \"point\" and the \"mark\". See:

  (find-enode \"Point\")
  (find-enode \"Mark\")

Exercise: understand how the `eek' sexp below switches the two
lines just after it.

  (eek \"<down> C-a C-SPC <down> C-w <down> C-y 3*<up>\")
  First
  Second








6. Controlling shell-like programs
==================================
This is the second main feature of eev. The hyperlinks thing used the
keys `M-e', `M-k', and `M-h M-h', plus standard Emacs keys for cutting
and pasting. The module of eev that controls shell-like programs - it
is called \"eepitch\" - uses `<F8>' and `M-T'. Note that it is
`alt-shift-t', to not interfere with Emacs's `M-t'.

For more details see:

  (find-eepitch-intro)
  (find-wrap-intro \"2. <M-T>: produce an eepitch block\")




6.1. The main key: <F8>
-----------------------
Emacs can run a shell in a buffer, and it can split its frame
into windows, like this:
   ___________________
  |         |         |
  |   our   |    a    |
  |  notes  |  shell  |
  |         |  buffer |
  |_________|_________|

The usual way to use a shell buffer is to move the cursor there
and type commands into its prompt; the eepitch-y way is to leave
the cursor at the \"notes\" buffer, write the commands for the
shell there, and send these commands to the shell with <F8>.

Here's what <F8> does:

  When we type <F8> on a line that starts with a red
  star (\"\"), it executes the rest of the line as Lisp, and
  moves down; when we type <F8> on a line that does not start
  with a \"\", it makes sure that the \"target buffer\" is being
  displayed (the \"target\" is usually the buffer called
  \"*shell*\"), it \"send\"s the current line to the target
  buffer, and moves down.

  \"Sending the current line to the target buffer\" means copying
  the contents of the current line to the target - as if the user
  had typed that line there by hand -, then \"typing\" a <RET> at
  the target buffet.

Please try that in the example after this paragraph, by typing
<F8> six times starting at the first line that says
\" (eepitch-shell)\". The three red star lines at the top will
create a target buffer, destroy it, and create it again; the
other three lines will send commands to the target shell.

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo \"We are at: $PWD\"
cd /tmp/
echo \"We changed to: $(pwd)\"




6.2. Other targets
------------------
Just like `(eepitch-shell)' creates a shell buffer and sets the
eepitch target to it, `(eepitch-python)' creates a buffer with a
Python interpreter and uses it as the eepitch target. Try:

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
def square (x):
    return x*x

print(square(5))

  We can use several targets at the time, alternating between them.
  For example:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo Hello... > /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())

 (eepitch-shell)
echo ...and bye >> /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())


  It is possible to display all the targets at the same time,
  using advanced features that are explained here:

    (find-multiwindow-intro \"find-3EE\")

  Here is a demo:

 (find-3EE '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))
 (eepitch-shell)
echo Hello... > /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())

 (eepitch-shell)
echo ...and bye >> /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())






6.3. Creating eepitch blocks: `M-T'
-----------------------------------
Write just \"shell\" or \"python\" in a line, then type
`M-T' (i.e., meta-shift-t) there. The line will be turned into
three - an \" (eepitch-xxx)\", an \" (eepitch-kill)\", and an
\" (eepitch-xxx)\". We call these blocks of three lines
\"eepitch blocks\". Try this below, converting the \"shell\" into
an eepitch block for starting a shell.

shell
pwd
cd /tmp/
pwd




6.4. Red stars
--------------
Eepitch.el sets the glyph for the char 15 to a red star in the
standard display table. In layman's terms: eepitch.el tells Emacs
that the character 15 should be displayed as a red star. The
character 15 corresponds to control-O, whose default
representation on screen would be \"^O\". You can enter a
literal ^O in a buffer by typing `C-q C-o'.




7. Quick access to one-liners
=============================

7.1. `eejump'
-------------
Some key sequences in Emacs accept numeric arguments. For
example, try typing `M-9 a' (not `M-9 M-a'!) - this will insert 9
copies of the letter `a'. See:

  (find-enode \"Arguments\")

Eev binds the key `M-j' (`eejump') to a function that jumps to a
place that depends on the numeric argument. For example, `M-5
M-j' runs (find-eev-quick-intro), that reloads this intro and
goes to the top of it, and

  `M-2 M-j' runs: (find-emacs-keys-intro)
  `M-6 M-j' runs: (find-escripts-intro)
  `M-1 M-j' runs: (find-fline \"~/TODO\")

The way to associate a number to a place to jump to - or, more
precisely, to a single-line piece of Elisp code, i.e., a
\"one-liner\" - is through code like this:

  (defun eejump-5 () (find-eev-quick-intro))
  (defun eejump-2 () (find-emacs-keys-intro))
  (defun eejump-6 () (find-escripts-intro))
  (defun eejump-1 () (find-fline \"~/TODO\"))

The pattern is:

  (defun eejump-<nnn> () <one-liner associated to the argument nnn>)

`defun' is explained here:

  (find-elnode \"Defining Functions\" \"(defun foo () 5)\")
  (find-eval-intro \"10. More on functions\")

As a special case, a plain `M-j' without a prefix argument runs a
special function, `find-eejumps', that shows a help text followed
by all the `(defun eejump-<nnn> () ...)'s that are currently
active. So:

      `M-j' runs: (find-eejumps)

Let's try to understand this from both a user's point of view and
from a technical point of view.

We may have elisp one-liners that we want to be able to execute very
quickly, and from anywhere. For example, I keep all my notes that I
have not organized yet in a file called \"~/TODO\", and if I type

  M-1 M-j

then I \"jump\" to \"~/TODO\" - the effect is the same as running this:

  (find-fline \"~/TODO\")

Note that `M-1 M-j' can be typed as:

  hold the meta key,
    type 1,
    type j,
  release the meta key.

instead of:

  hold the meta key,
    type 1,
  release the meta key,
  hold the meta key,
    type j,
  release the meta key;

There is no need to release and press again the meta key between
the `1' and the `j'.

Internally, what happens when you type `M-1 M-j' is this:

  `M-j' is bound to `eejump',
  `M-1 M-j' runs `eejump' with argument 1, i.e., (eejump 1),
  (eejump 1) runs (eejump-1),
  (eejump-1) has been defined with:

    (defun eejump-1 () (find-fline \"~/TODO\"))

So `M-1 M-j' runs the one-liner `(find-fline \"~/TODO\")'.
Similarly, `M-5 M-j' runs the one-liner `(find-eev-quick-intro)',
and so on.

We will sometimes refer to the one-liner associated to the
argument nnn as the \"eejump target associated to nnn\", or just
as the \"target associated to nnn\".





7.2. The list of eejump targets
-------------------------------
If you type `M-j' without a prefix argument then it runs
`(find-eejumps)', that displays a help text followed by all the
current eejump targets as defuns, one in each line. Try it:

  (eek \"M-j\")
  (find-eejumps)

You will see that two of those entries are:

  (defun eejump-1 () (find-fline \"~/TODO\"))
  (defun eejump-5 () (find-eev-quick-intro))



7.3. Defining eejump targets
----------------------------
We can define new eejump targets, or overwrite the current ones, by
just running `defun's to define functions with names starting with
`eejump-'. Try:

  (defun eejump-9 () (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.2.\"))
  (defun eejump-9 () (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.3.\"))
  (fmakunbound 'eejump-9)
  (find-eejumps)

Note that if you type `M-J' (i.e., meta-uppercase-j,
`eewrap-eejump') on the line below then it will be converted into
the first \"(defun eejump- ...)\" above:

  9 (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.2.\")

An advanced feature: if you type `M-J' on a line that starts with
something that is not a number, you get a defun for a \"command
with a very short name\" like the ones that are described in the
next section. Try it now:

  (eek \"<down> M-J\")
  e (find-fline \"/tmp/foo.tex\")




7.4. Commands with very short names
-----------------------------------
Let's start with an example. If we are editing a LaTeX file, say
\"/tmp/foo.tex\", then it is convenient to have quick ways to:

  c) [c]ompile \"foo.tex\" into a \"foo.pdf\",
  d) [d]isplay the resulting \"foo.pdf\",
  e) jump to \"foo.tex\" from anywhere to [e]dit it.

If our \"/tmp/foo.tex\" starts with these lines

  % (defun c () (interactive) (find-sh \"cd /tmp/; pdflatex foo.tex\"))
  % (defun d () (interactive) (find-xpdfpage \"/tmp/foo.pdf\"))
  % (defun e () (interactive) (find-fline \"/tmp/foo.tex\"))

and we execute these defuns, then from that point on `M-x c', `M-x d'
and `M-x e' will do \"compile\", \"display\" and \"edit\" on \"foo.tex\", as
described above.

For more on `M-x', and on why the defuns above need the
\"(interactive)\", see:

  (find-node \"(emacs)M-x\")
  (find-node \"(emacs)Commands\")
  (find-node \"(elisp)Defining Commands\")




7.5. `find-latex-links'
-----------------------
The easiest way to put the three defuns of the last section in
the header of a LaTeX file is with:

  (find-latex-links \"/tmp/foo\")

`find-latex-links' is just one of several template functions that
generate commands with very short names. Here's how to use it -
the other ones are similar.

  1) Run `M-x find-latex-links'. You will get a buffer whose top
     line is:

       # (find-latex-links \"{stem}\")

  2) Edit that, and change the \"{stem}\" to \"/tmp/foo\".

  3) Execute that top line, which is now:

       # (find-latex-links \"/tmp/foo\")

     You should get something like:

   _____________________________________________________________________
  |# (find-latex-links \"/tmp/foo\")                                      |
  |# (find-eev-quick-intro \"`find-latex-links'\")                        |
  |# (ee-copy-rest 1 '(find-fline \"/tmp/foo.tex\"))                      |
  |                                                                     |
  |% (defun c () (interactive) (find-sh \"pdflatex foo.tex\"))            |
  |% (defun d () (interactive) (find-pdf-page \"/tmp/foo.pdf\"))          |
  |% (defun e () (interactive) (find-fline \"/tmp/foo.tex\"))             |
  |%                                                                    |
  |\\documentclass{article}                                              |
  |\\begin{document}                                                     |
  |                                                                     |
  |\\end{document}                                                       |
  |                                                                     |
  |                                                                     |
  | -:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L1     (Fundamental)                |
  |_____________________________________________________________________|


  4) Execute the line with the \"(ee-copy-rest ...)\". You should get this -
     the window on the right is visiting the file \"/tmp/foo.tex\":

  | -:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L| -:**-  foo.tex        All L9     |
  |_____________________________________________________________________|

  and you can now save the file foo.tex (hint: use `C-x C-s'!),
  execute the three defuns for `c', `d', and `e', and jump to
  \"/tmp/foo.tex\" from anywhere with `M-x e'.

  A detailed explanation of `ee-copy-rest' can be found here:

    (find-eev \"eev-tlinks.el\" \"ee-copy-rest\")





8. Anchors
==========

8.1. Introduction: `to'
-----------------------
A hyperlink like

  (to \"foo\")

jumps to the first occurrence of the string \"«foo»\" in the
current buffer. The function that wraps a string in `«»'s is
called `ee-format-as-anchor', and the sexp `(to \"foo\")'
is equivalent the second sexp below:

                    (ee-format-as-anchor \"foo\")
  (ee-goto-position (ee-format-as-anchor \"foo\"))

We will call strings in `«»'s _anchors_, and we will say
that `(to \"foo\")' jumps \"to the anchor `foo'\". The string
inside a `«»'s is called a _tag_.

In a situation like this,

  «one»     (to \"two\")
  «two»     (to \"three\")
  «three»   (to \"four\")
  «four»    (to \"one\")

we have four anchors, and typing `M-e' at the line with the
anchor \"one\" takes us to the line with the anchor \"two\",
typing `M-e' at the line with the anchor \"two\" takes us to the
line with the anchor \"three\", typing `M-e' again takes us to
the line with the anchor \"four\", and typing `M-e' again takes
us back to the line with the anchor \"one\". In a situation like
this we say that the anchors \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", and
\"four\" _point to one another_.

In a case like this,

  «.five»   (to \"five\")
   «five»  (to \".five\")

where the names of two anchors pointing to one another differ by
an initial dot, we will say that the anchor \".five\" is the
\"index anchor\", and the anchor \"five\" is the \"section
anchor\"; and one way to create an index for a file is to group
all the index anchors together. For an example, see:

  (find-eev \"eev-intro.el\" \".find-eev-intro\")



8.2. Creating anchors by hand
-----------------------------
One way to type the chars `«' and `»' is with `C-x 8 <' and
`C-x 8 >'. Try:

  (eek \"RET C-x 8 < t a g C-x 8 >\")




8.3. Creating index/section anchor pairs
----------------------------------------
Eev has several commands that transform the text in the current
line into something more complex. They are all called
`eewrap-(something)', and they are bound to
meta-uppercase-letters. The simplest examples are `M-F', `M-S'
and `M-M', that just \"wrap the text in the current line into an
elisp hyperlink\" by adding a prefix and a suffix; if you run
`M-F', `M-S' and `M-M' in the following lines

/tmp/
ls /tmp/
ls

they become this:

# (find-fline \"/tmp/\")
# (find-sh \"ls /tmp/\")
# (find-man \"ls\")

You can also try them by running the `eek' sexps below,

\(eek \"<down> M-F\")
/tmp/

\(eek \"<down> M-S\")
ls /tmp/

\(eek \"<down> M-M\")
ls

HINT: sometimes the eewrap commands don't do exactly what we
want, so learn how to use the \"undo\" command of Emacs. See:

  (find-emacs-keys-intro \"5. Undoing\")

The command `eewrap-anchor' (bound to `M-A') is similar to those
above, but it parses the current line in a more complex way -
everything between \"<>\" is the \"anchor\" and everything before
the \"<\" is the \"comment prefix\" - and it converts the current
line into two lines with `to's, each one pointing to the other
one. For example, `M-A' in the line below

  # <first-test>

yields this:

  # «.first-test»	(to \"first-test\")
  # «first-test» (to \".first-test\")

The line with the anchor \"«.first-test»\" is intended to be
moved - by hand, with cut and paste - to the index section at the
beginning of the file, as explained here:

  (find-escripts-intro)




8.4. Creating e-script blocks
-----------------------------
The key `M-B' (`eewrap-escript-block') is a variant of `M-A' that
converts the current line into nine (!) lines instead of two. If
we type `M-B' on the line below

  second-test Long description

it becomes this - the header of an \"e-script block\":

#####
#
# Long description
# 2018may22
#
#####

# «.second-test»	(to \"second-test\")
# «second-test» (to \".second-test\")

where again the line with the anchor \"«.second-test»\" is
intended to be moved to the index section at the beginning of the
file. The use of these \"e-script blocks\" is explained bere:

  (find-escripts-intro)




8.5. Hyperlinks to anchors in other files
-----------------------------------------
`find-anchor' is like `find-fline', but it interprets the first
argument after the file in a special way if it is present. These
hyperlinks are all equivalent:

  (find-anchor \"~/eev2/eev-blinks.el\" \"find-wottb\")
  (find-anchor \"~/eev2/eev-blinks.el\" (ee-format-as-anchor \"find-wottb\"))
  (find-fline  \"~/eev2/eev-blinks.el\" \"«find-wottb»\")

You can use this - or the shorter hyperlinks to anchors in
section 9.3 - to point to anchors or to e-script blocks in your
files.






9. Shorter hyperlinks
=====================
See also: (find-code-c-d-intro)

9.1. `code-c-d'
---------------
Sexps like

  (find-eevfile \"\")
  (find-eevfile \"eev-blinks.el\")
  (find-eevfile \"eev-blinks.el\" \"«find-sh»\")
  (find-udfile \"\")
  (find-udfile \"lua5.1-doc/\")
  (find-udfile \"lua5.1-doc/test/\")
  (find-udfile \"lua5.1-doc/test/fib.lua\")
  (find-udfile \"lua5.1-doc/test/fib.lua\" \"function fib(n)\")

work as abbreviations for

  (find-fline \"~/eev2/\")
  (find-fline \"~/eev2/eev-blinks.el\")
  (find-fline \"~/eev2/eev-blinks.el\" \"«find-sh»\")
  (find-fline \"/usr/share/doc/\")
  (find-fline \"/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/\")
  (find-fline \"/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/test/\")
  (find-fline \"/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/test/fib.lua\")
  (find-fline \"/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/test/fib.lua\" \"function fib(n)\")

They are \"mass-produced\", in the following sense. When we run this,

  (code-c-d \"ud\" \"/usr/share/doc/\")

the function `code-c-d' produces a big string using a template, and
evaluates that big string; the \"{c}\"s in the template are replaced by
the argument \"ud\" - called the \"code\" - and the \"{d}\"s in the template
are replaced by \"/usr/share/doc/\" - called the \"directory\". If we add
a \"find-\" before the `code-c-d', like this,

  (find-code-c-d \"ud\" \"/usr/share/doc/\")

we get a hyperlink to the code that `(code-c-d \"ud\" \"/usr/share/doc/\")'
would execute - i.e., to the result of substiting the \"{c}\"s and
\"{d}\"s in the template. This is useful for understanding how
`code-c-d' works; each call to `code-c-d' defines lots of functions,
some of them easier to explain, some harder. This, for example,

  (find-eevgrep \"grep --color -nH -e '(code-c-d ' *.el\")

greps for all calls to \"code-c-d\" in the source of eev.

By default, eev runs these `code-c-d's:

  (find-eevfile \"eev-code.el\" \"code-c-d \\\"e\\\"\")

You can add many more of them to your .emacs file.

An introduction to the ideas, details, innards and technicalities of
`code-c-d' can be found here:

  (find-code-c-d-intro)



9.2. Extra arguments to `code-c-d'
----------------------------------
If you compare the buffers generated by

  (find-code-c-d      \"CODE\" \"/DIR/\")
  (find-code-c-d      \"CODE\" \"/DIR/\" :info \"INFO\")
  (find-code-c-d-rest \"CODE\" \"/DIR/\" :info \"INFO\")

you will see that the `:info \"INFO\"' part adds some code to the end of
the generated string, and that the `find-code-c-d-rest' shows only
this extra code.

The most important extra arguments to `code-c-d' are:

  1) :info \"name-of-an-info-manual\"
  2) :gz
  3) :anchor

If the first extra argument is a string then `ee-code-c-d' adds an
`:info' before it, so these generate the same code:

  (find-code-c-d \"CODE\" \"/DIR/\"       \"INFO\")
  (find-code-c-d \"CODE\" \"/DIR/\" :info \"INFO\")

The eev source has this (in the file \"eev-code.el\"),

  (code-c-d \"e\"   ee-emacs-lisp-directory :info \"emacs\" :gz)
  (code-c-d \"eev\" ee-eev-source-directory :anchor)

and that code

  1) makes (find-enode \"\")
     work as an abbreviation for (find-node \"(emacs)\")

  2) makes (find-efile \"files.el\")
     run   (find-efile \"files.el.gz\")
     if the file \"files.el\" is not found,

  3) makes (find-eev     \"eev-blinks.el\" \"find-wottb\")
     run:  (find-eevfile \"eev-blinks.el\" \"«find-wottb»\")
     or actually: (find-anchor (ee-eevfile \"eev-blinks.el\") \"find-wottb\")

Calls to `find-eev' are \"short hyperlinks to anchors\":

  (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\" \"find-wottb\")
  (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\" \"find-wottb\" \"defun find-wottb-call\")

For the technical details of the implementation, see here:

  (find-code-c-d-intro \"Extra arguments to `code-c-d'\")




9.3. Hyperlinks to PDF files
----------------------------
This section was moved to another tutorial! See:

  (find-pdf-like-intro \"2. Preparation\")
  (find-pdf-like-intro \"3. Hyperlinks to PDF files\")

Here is a very short summary. If you have run the preparation, by
executing the eepitch block below with <f8>s,

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
  cd
  wget -nc https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf

then these sexps will be hyperlinks to a page of a PDF, and to
some string in it...

  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")




9.4. Shorter hyperlinks to PDF files
------------------------------------
...and the `code-pdf-page' and `code-pdf-text' sexps below

  (code-pdf-page \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (code-pdf-text \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" -110)

define the functions `find-livesofanimalspage' and
`find-livesofanimalstext', and the two sexps below

  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")

are now short hyperlinks to a page of a PDF, and to a string in
it.



9.5. Hyperlinks to audio and video files
----------------------------------------
Eev has some support for creating hyperlinks and short hyperlinks
to positions in audio files and video files, but it is not as
mature as the support for hyperlinks to positions in PDF files.
See:

  (find-audiovideo-intro)





10. Generating short hyperlinks
===============================

10.1. Generating short hyperlinks to files
------------------------------------------
If you run this

  (code-c-d \"foo\"  \"/tmp/FOO/\")
  (code-c-d \"bar\"  \"/tmp/FOO/BAR/\")
  (code-c-d \"plic\" \"/tmp/FOO/BAR/PLIC/\")

then these five links will all point to the same file:

  (find-file  \"/tmp/FOO/BAR/PLIC/bletch\")
  (find-fline \"/tmp/FOO/BAR/PLIC/bletch\")
  (find-foofile        \"BAR/PLIC/bletch\")
  (find-barfile            \"PLIC/bletch\")
  (find-plicfile                \"bletch\")

That file does not exist, but that is not important in the tests.
Note that the last three sexps are short hyperlinks. If you run

  (eek \"<down> M-3 M-e  ;; open the hyperlink below in the right window\")
  (find-file-links \"/tmp/FOO/BAR/PLIC/bletch\")

it will create an elisp hyperlinks buffer in which the last sexps
will be the three different short hyperlinks to
\"/tmp/FOO/BAR/PLIC/bletch\" above.

Remember that `find-here-links' - i.e., `M-h M-h' - can act in
several different ways depending on the context, i.e., depending
on what is \"here\". If you type `M-h M-h' in a buffer visiting a
file it runs a slight variation of `find-file-links' on that
file, and if you visit our test file with, say,

  (find-plicfile                \"bletch\")

and type `M-h M-h' there then one of the hyperlinks that will be
shown will be exactly the one with `find-plicfile'.

This works for all files. If you visit a file and type `M-h M-h'
then the last hyperlinks in the temporary buffer will be the
short hyperlinks to that file.




10.2. Generating short hyperlinks to info nodes
-----------------------------------------------
If you run this

  (code-c-d \"el\" ee-emacs-lisp-directory \"elisp\")

then these three hyperlinks will point to the same info node:

  (info      \"(elisp)Top\")
  (find-node \"(elisp)Top\")
  (find-elnode      \"Top\")

Note that the last one is a short hyperlink. If you open that
info node and type `M-h M-h' this will run `find-here-links',
that will run something similar to:

  (find-einfo-links \"(elisp)Top\")

The code that produces the short hyperlink to an info node is not
currently very smart. If you look at the definition of
`find-elnode' here

  (find-code-c-d \"el\" ee-emacs-lisp-directory \"elisp\")

you will see that it saves the \"el\" and the \"elisp\" in global
variables by running this:

  (setq ee-info-code \"el\")
  (setq ee-info-file \"elisp\")

The short hyperlink to an info node is only produced when Info is
visting a node in a manual whose name matches the variable
`ee-info-file'.




10.3. Generating short hyperlinks to intros
-------------------------------------------
Let's see an example. If you follow this link and type `M-h M-h',

  (find-multiwindow-intro)

you will get an \"*Elisp hyperlinks*\" buffer whose last line
will be:

  # (find-multiwindow-intro)

which is a short hyperlink to the intro.




10.4. Generating short hyperlinks to PDFs
-----------------------------------------
This section was moved to:

  (find-pdf-like-intro \"9. Generating three pairs\")





10.5. Generating short hyperlinks to anchors
--------------------------------------------






11. Generating `code-c-d's and friends
======================================
There are two main ways to generate lines like these

  (code-c-d      \"asy\" \"/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/asymptote/\")
  (code-pdf-page \"asy\" \"/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/asymptote/asymptote.pdf\")
  (code-pdf-text \"asy\" \"/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/asymptote/asymptote.pdf\")

without having to type much. One way, that is somewhat confusing,
is with `M-C' (`eewrap-code-c-d') and `M-P' (`eewrap-pdflike');
you can test it by running the `eek' sexps below:

  (eek \"<down> M-C\")
  asy /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/asymptote/

  (eek \"<down> M-P\")
  asy /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/asymptote/asymptote.pdf

We will only discuss here the other way.

This buffer is _temporary_ and _editable_.
It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.
The quickest way to open or recreate this is with `M-2 M-j'.



1. Basic keys (eev)
===================
The most basic keys of eev are:
  M-e   - to follow a hyperlink.  Mnemonic: \"(e)valuate\"/\"(e)xecute\".
          See: (find-eev-quick-intro \"2. Evaluating Lisp\")
               (find-eev-quick-intro \"3. Elisp hyperlinks\")
  M-k   - to go back.  Mnemonic: \"(k)ill buffer\".
          See: (find-eev-quick-intro \"3. Elisp hyperlinks\" \"M-k\")
  M-K   - to go back without killing the buffer.
          See: (find-eval-intro \"5. Going back\")
               (find-eval-intro \"5. Going back\" \"`M-K' instead of `M-k'\")
  M-j   - to jump to certain predefined places - in particular,
              `M-j' takes you to the list of jump targets.
          `M-2 M-j' takes you to this help page.
          `M-5 M-j' takes you to: (find-eev-quick-intro)
  <f8>  - See: (find-eev-quick-intro \"6. Controlling shell-like programs\")
  M-T   - See: (find-eev-quick-intro \"6.3. Creating eepitch blocks: `M-T'\")

The beginner's way of creating \"hyperlinks to here\" is with:
  M-h M-3   - (find-here-links-intro \"4. `find-here-links-3'\")
  M-h M-1   - (find-here-links-intro \"5. `find-here-links-1'\")

Note: this intro contains lots of very technical information!
If you're a beginner you should skip this - but if you use
Windows then this page may be relevant to you:
  http://angg.twu.net/installing-eev-on-windows.html




1. Beginners and experts
========================
When I teach Emacs and eev to beginners in workshops I install
Emacs and eev in their machines using a \"beginners setup\" like
the one described here,

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"1. Installing eev\")

that lets them start Emacs displaying the main eev tutorial and
with eev-mode on; then I teach them how to use `M-e' to follow
elisp hyperlinks, and I show them that if they type just `M-j'
they get a page with some nice & important hyperlinks at its
header... then usually in less that five minutes - with a bit of
help - they figure out how to navigate the documentation and how
to do the exercises.

When I show eev to long-time Emacs users I recommend them to
install eev using an \"expert setup\" that is very non-intrusive,
and that does not turn eev-mode on. With eev installed but
eev-mode off all elisp hyperlinks functions are still available,
even the ones that define \"shorter hyperlinks\", like the ones
described in these sections,

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9. Shorter hyperlinks\")
  (find-pdf-like-intro \"7. Shorter hyperlinks to PDF files\")

and people can execute sexps with `C-x C-e'. People using the
expert setup can turn eev-mode on and off - i.e., activate and
disactivate its keybindings - with `M-x eev-mode', and when
`eev-mode' is on they can go to the main tutorials with:

  `M-5 M-j'  -  (find-eev-quick-intro)
  `M-2 M-j'  -  (find-emacs-keys-intro)

or by following the links at the header of the page displayed by
`M-j'. Try:

      `M-j'  -  (find-eejumps)

I try to assume that long-time Emacsers are too busy with their
other things, and that it's ok if they only spend 5 minutes per
month playing with the eev tutorials.





2. The expert setup
===================
The \"expert setup\" described above corresponds to downloading
eev and then running something equivalent to this:

  (add-to-list 'load-path \"~/path-to-the-eev-source/\")
  (require 'eev-load)

If you installed eev with `M-x list-packages' - see:

  (find-enode \"Packages\")

then the line that adjusts the load-path should not be needed.

Here's what `(require 'eev-load)' does:

  1) Several functions and variables become defined. They ALL
     have the prefixes \"find-\", \"ee\", \"code-\" or \"br\",
     except for one: \"to\".

  2) The standard-display-table is changed to make three
     characters be displayed as colored glyphs: \"\" (char 15),
     \"«\" (char 171), and \"»\" (char 187).
     
  3) The environment variables \"S\" and \"EEVDIR\" are set.

  4) An innocuous wrapper is installed around an internal
     function used by `man'. See:

       (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\" \"find-man\")

Eev has very few autoloads, so eev-load.el loads all source files
except for eev-beginner.el. See:

  (find-eev \"eev-load.el\")
  (find-eev \"eev-load.el\" \"autoloads\")




3. The beginner setup
=====================
The \"beginner setup\" corresponds to the expert setup plus this:

  (eev-beginner)

where `eev-beginner' turns eev-mode on and runs:

  (find-eev-quick-intro)

See:

  (find-eev \"eev-beginner.el\")
  
If you have installed eev by following these instructions

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"1. Installing eev\")

then the script \"~/eev\" will run `(eev-beginner)' for you.

In the beginner setup for Windows people have to execute `M-x
eev-beginner' by hand when they start Emacs.




4. `eev-mode'
=============
Turning on eev-mode simply activates the eev-mode-map keymap, and
adds an \"eev\" to the mode line to remind you this. Turning off
eev-mode deactivates the keymap and the reminder.

See:

  (find-eev \"eev-mode.el\")
  (find-eev \"eev-mode.el\" \"eev-mode\")
  (find-efunctiondescr        'eev-mode)
  (find-eminormodekeymapdescr 'eev-mode)
  (find-efunctiondescr        'eev-avadj-mode)
  (find-eminormodekeymapdescr 'eev-avadj-mode)




5. Ways to download eev
=======================
These are the current ways to download and install eev:

  1. as an Emacs package, with `M-x list-packages';

  2. as an Emacs package, by downloading a file named
     eev-YYYYMMDD.tar from either ELPA or angg.twu.net using
     links like these ones,

       http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/eev.html
       http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/eev-20191003.tar
       http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/
       http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/eev-20191003.tar

     and then running `M-x package-install-file';

  3. by using the script in section 1, that downloads a .tgz from

       http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/eev2.tgz ,

     unpacks it in the directory ~/eev/ and creates a script
     called \"~/eev\" that starts Emacs loading eev and opening
     the main tutorial,

  4. by downloading the .tgz above and unpacking it, and then
     running these lines yourself:

       (add-to-list 'load-path \"~/path-to-the-eev-source/\")
       (require 'eev-load)
       (eev-mode 1)               ; optional

  5. by downloading the git repo from

       https://github.com/edrx/eev.git

     and then running this:

       (add-to-list 'load-path \"~/path-to-the-eev-source/\")
       (require 'eev-load)
       (eev-mode 1)               ; optional




5.1. Using the git repository
-----------------------------
The git repository for eev is at:

  https://github.com/edrx/eev.git

Try this:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
  rm -Rfv /tmp/eev2
  mkdir   /tmp/eev2/
  cd      /tmp/eev2/ && git clone https://github.com/edrx/eev.git .
  cd      /tmp/eev2/
  # (find-gitk \"/tmp/eev2/\")
  {
    echo '#!/bin/sh'
    echo 'cd /tmp/eev2/ && emacs -l eev-readme.el --eval=\"(find-eev-quick-intro)\"'
  } > /tmp/eev
  chmod 755 /tmp/eev

  /tmp/eev

Note the \"cd ... && git clone URL .\". This is needed because if
we don't specify a directory after the URL in \"git clone\" then
git will create a directory /tmp/eev/, and that would be
incompatible with our convention of creating a script called
\"eev\" (\"/tmp/eev\" in this case).



5.2. Installation quirks
------------------------
There were a couple of situations around may/2019 which I was
helping friends who had installed eev on Windows with `M-x
list-packages' and we found out that we had to add
a `(package-initialize)' to their \".emacs\"s to make things
work... I still need to understand this. See:

  (find-es \"emacs\" \"package-initialize\")

If you have installed both an eev from ELPA and an eev from the
.tgz or from the git repo then one of them will be found first in
the load-path. Check with one.





6. `find-eev-install-links'
===========================
There is this,

  (find-eev-install-links)

but I sort of forgot it, and I haven't updated it recently...
note that it is somehow similar to this,

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.5. `find-latex-links'\")

and follows most of the same conventions. See:

  (find-elnode \"Init File\" \".emacs\")
  (find-elnode \"Init Examples\")
  (find-elnode \"Init File Examples\")
  (find-eev-install-links \"~/eev2/\" \"~/eev\" \"\" 2 \".emacs\")




7. Eev as an ELPA/MELPA package
===============================
In march 2019 I prepared a first version of an emacs package for
eev to make it installable by `M-x list-packages' - see:

  (find-enode    \"Packages\")
  (find-efaqnode \"Packages that do not come with Emacs\")

and submitted it to the emacs-devel mailing list:

  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2019-03/msg00433.html

Stefan Monnier answered, and the rest of the discussion happened
off-list. Apparently eev could go into GNU ELPA, but some changes
and clean-ups were needed. I implemented most of what he
proposed/requested, but three of the things that he asked for
would demand changes that would make eev far less elegant and far
less useful for beginners... in rough terms, the code should 1)
be byte-compilable, 2) be compatible with lexical binding, and 3)
have all the autoloads. My reasons for not complying - or for not
complying NOW - are explained in the subsections below.

Btw: except for Stefan's e-mails ***100%*** the feedback that I
received about eev in the last three years came from beginners.
I am not willing to make changes that will make eev
beginner-UNfriendly.

UPDATE: in 2019apr14 eev became a part of ELPA even despite its
quirks!!! Its ELPA page is here:

  http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/eev.html




7.1. Byte-compilation
---------------------
In standard packages all elisp files should be byte-compilable
unless there is a very strong reason - but all eev source files
have a \"no-byte-compile: t\" in their local variables section.
See:

  (find-eevgrep \"grep --color -nH -e no-byte-compile: *.el\")
  (find-elnode \"Byte Compilation\" \"no-byte-compile: t\")

Here is why. Each call to a `code-*' function defines some
functions dynamically - for example, `(code-c-d \"e\" ...)'
defines `find-efile' - and the best way to inspect a function
defined in this way is by using `find-functionpp'. Try:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\" \"(find-code-c-d\")
  (find-code-c-d \"e\" ee-emacs-lisp-directory \"emacs\" :gz)
  (find-efunction-links 'find-efile)
  (symbol-function  'find-efile)
  (find-efunctionpp 'find-efile)
  (find-efunctionpp 'ee-efile)
  (find-evardescr 'ee-edir)

These functions are not byte-compiled, so the contents of their
function cells are lambda expressions, which are easy to read.
Compare:

  (symbol-function  'find-efile)
  (find-efunctionpp 'find-efile)
  (symbol-function  'find-file)
  (find-efunctionpp 'find-file)

The relevant sections in the manual are:

  (find-elnode \"What Is a Function\")
  (find-elnode \"What Is a Function\" \"lambda expression\")
  (find-elnode \"What Is a Function\" \"byte-code function\")
  (find-elnode \"Lambda Expressions\")
  (find-elnode \"Function Cells\")

If we don't byte-compile the modules of eev then beginners will
have a reasonable corpus of functions for which
`find-efunctionpp' shows something readable, which is good to
help them understand the innards of Emacs.

Here is an excerpt of one of my e-mails to Stefan:

  I have the impression - please correct me if I'm wrong - that
  you're proposing to replace the `find-efunctionpp' by something
  more modern. My view is that we have a \"new\" Emacs, that
  enforces byte-compilation and uses several data structures that
  are relatively opaque, built on top on an \"old\" Emacs that
  uses lots of simpler data structures, but in which many things
  are messier and more error-prone. I would love to add to eev
  functions to inspect these new data structures, but the \"old\"
  Emacs is the one that made me fell in love with Free Software
  and that made me spend years trying to convert people... and
  one of the underlying messages of eev is \"look, you can still
  use these simpler things\". Maybe I'm using \"simpler\" in a
  sense that is not very usual, so let me quote a paragraph from
  an article that I wrote about implementing a Forth in Lua:

    \"I've met many people over the years who have been Forth
    enthusiasts in the past, and we often end up discussing what
    made Forth so thrilling to use at that time - and what we can
    do to adapt its ideas to the computers of today. My personal
    impression is that Forth's main points were not the ones that
    I listed at the beginning of this section, and that I said
    that were easy to quantify; rather, what was most important
    was that nothing was hidden, there were no complex data
    structures around with \"don't-look-at-this\" parts (think on
    garbage collection in Lua, for example, and Lua's tables -
    beginners need to be convinced to see these things
    abstractly, as the concrete details of the implementation are
    hard), and everything - code, data, dictionaries, stacks -
    were just linear sequences of bytes, that could be read and
    modified directly if we wished to. We had total freedom,
    defining new words was quick, and experiments were quick to
    make; that gave us a sense of power that was totally
    different from, say, the one that a Python user feels today
    because he has huge libraries at his fingertips.\"

    (From: http://angg.twu.net/miniforth-article.html)




7.2. Dynamic binding
--------------------
Dependency on dynamic binding should be avoided - see:

  (find-elnode \"Dynamic Binding\")
  (find-elnode \"Dynamic Binding Tips\")
  (find-elnode \"Lexical Binding\")

but the main function that eev uses for template strings is
intrinsically incompatible with lexical binding. See the comments
in its source file:

  (find-eev \"eev-template0.el\")



7.3. Autoloads
--------------
I decided to mark only one function in eev as autoloadable -
instead of hundreds - and this is very non-standard. See the
comments in:

  (find-eev \"eev-load.el\")

and also:

  (find-eev \"README\")
  (find-eev \"eev-beginner.el\")

1. `eev-mode'
=============
To toggle eev-mode on and off, use `M-x eev-mode'.

The text below is a copy of:

  (find-eev-install-intro \"1. Installing eev by hand\")

Note that eev-mode.el has this commentary:

  ;; Turning on eev-mode simply activates the eev-mode-map keymap, and
  ;; adds an \"eev\" to the mode line to remind you this. Turning off
  ;; eev-mode deactivates the keymap and the reminder. 

If you prefer to start with eev-mode off, omit the
line `(eev-mode 1)' above or change it to `(eev-mode 0)'. To
toggle eev-mode on and off, use `M-x eev'. The keybindings in
eev-mode are listed here:

  (find-eev \"eev-mode.el\" \"eev-mode-map-set\")

Years ago eev was a very invasive package that changed several
global settings; now it's the opposite. If you load eev the only
things that happen are:

  1) Several functions and variables become defined. They ALL
     have the prefixes \"find-\", \"ee\", \"code-\" or \"br\",
     except for one: \"to\".

  2) The standard-display-table is changed to make three
     characters be displayed as colored glyphs: \"\" (char 15),
     \"«\" (char 171), and \"»\" (char 187).
     
  3) The environment variables \"S\" and \"EEVDIR\" are set.

  4) An innocuous wrapper is installed around an internal
     function used by `man'. See:

       (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\" \"find-man\")

TODO: update the text above! I rewrote most
of `(find-eev-install-intro)' in 2019sep29... See:

  (find-eev-install-intro \"1. Beginners and experts\")
  (find-eev-install-intro \"2. The expert setup\" \"Here's what\")
  (find-eev-install-intro \"4. `eev-mode'\")





3. The keybindings
==================
`eev-mode' defines its own meanings for lots of meta-shift-letter
key combinations - which are not normally used by Emacs - and,
besides that, only for:

  `M-e'    (find-eval-intro \"`M-e'\")
  `M-k'    (find-eval-intro \"`M-k'\")
  `M-j'    (find-eejump-intro \"\\neejump\\n\")
  `M-h'    (find-links-intro \"Elisp hyperlinks buffers\")
  `<f8>'   (find-eepitch-intro \"The main key: <F8>\")

For the full lists of keybindings, see:

Eev's central idea is that you can keep \"executable logs\" of
what you do, in a format that is reasonably readable and that is
easy to \"play back\" later, step by step and in any order. We
call these executable logs, or executable notes, \"e-scripts\".




1. Alternating between \"task\" and \"notes\"
=========================================
In the old days log books were always made of paper, and there
was nothing automatic in taking notes with them. We would have to
decide what to write and how to write it, and we would have to
alternate between the \"task\" and \"taking notes\". After many
years of practice _some_ people would learn how to take notes
without distracting themselves much from the task at hand, and
they would learn how to make their notes at the same time concise
and readable enough.

Nowadays, with computers, there are _some_ ways to write logs
automatically - for example, most shells record the commands
given to them - but the output is of low quality.

Eev takes an intermediate stance between \"notes by hand\"
and \"automatic notes\". It is possible to do
\"task\"+\"notes\" with just a few more keystrokes than for
doing just \"task\", but that requires learning some tricks,
and having some practice.



1.1. Reading and writing
------------------------
Learning eev is like learning to read and write. We first learn
_how to read_, and we learn _how to write_ in a second stage,
when we have read a lot and we are able to read what we write.

Learning eev is also like learning to use paper notebooks. It is
much easier to understand the notes and ideas what we wrote
ourselves in our notebooks than to understand what other people
wrote in their notebooks... when we go back to what _we_ wrote we
are able to reconnect with what we were thinking, even when our
notes are quite terse because we did not write down all details -
and we can't do that with other people's notes.

So: we have to first learn how to _read_ executable notes in
order to be able to _write_ our own executable notes, but after
learning the basics we will usually find it much easier to read
our own executable notes than to read other people's notes...

This is very similar to what happens in programming. Programmers
usually takes years, and a lot of effort, to learn to write code
and comments that other people find readable, and what they do
after that is not that they write super-readable code all the
time - instead they _adjust_ the level of readability of their
code depending on the situation: they write the code that will be
used and read by other people in a cleaner, more readable style
with lots of comments, and they write \"throwaway code\" that
they will only run once in a very terse, and often messy, style.

Most of my executable notes are written - or rather, \"appear\" -
when I am learning something and I am switching rather mindlessly
between \"task\" and \"notes\" as I explained in the previous
section. What I write looks like throwaway code, only worse -
because I usually leave lots of unfinished parts intermixed with
the parts that run, without marking clearly which are which...
but when I go through my notes about a task again I usually clean
my notes a bit. For me going through my executable notes about a
task again always involves a bit of _rewriting_ - which is
something that programmers often do with their own code, but that
we don't do much with paper notebooks.

Anyway: be prepared to create executable notes that are almost
unreadable, even by you when you go back to them a few hours
later - that's normal, that's how things are, and you can, and
WILL, rewrite the most useful parts...

Note that this \"intro\" is about writing elisp hyperlinks. The
tricks for writing eepitch blocks and index-anchor pairs are
discussed elsewhere.





2. \"Here\"
=========
In this tutorial we will learn the basic technique for creating
an elisp hyperlink to \"here\" and copying it to our notes.
\"Here\" means the current Emacs buffer; we saw in the main
tutorial that elisp hyperlinks like

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"4. Creating Elisp Hyperlinks\")
  (find-emacs-keys-intro \"3. Cutting & pasting\")
  (find-fline \"~/\")
  (find-eevfile \"\")
  (find-eevfile \"eev-blinks.el\")
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)
  (find-enode \"Modes\")
  (find-elnode \"Defining Functions\" \"(defun foo () 5)\")
  (find-man \"date\")

open eev tutorials (`find-xxx-intro's), directories, files,
descriptions of emacs functions, sections of manuals in \"info\"
format, and manpages. All the elisp hyperlinks above are of the
kind described in the first paragraphs of this section of the
main tutorial:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3. Elisp hyperlinks\")

They (usually) create a new buffer, and it is possible to \"go
back\" from that buffer with `M-k' of `M-K':

  (find-eval-intro \"5. Going back\")




3. `find-here-links'
====================
Eev has a function, called `find-here-links' and bound to `M-h
M-h', that is able to distinguish several kinds of \"here\"s.
When we run it it creates a temporary buffer with lots of elisp
hyperlinks, and when we have enough practice we can spot in a
second which of its hyperlinks is the \"hyperlink to here\" that
we want to copy to our notes.

This tutorial is about a _variant_ of `find-here-links' that is
more suitable for beginners.




4. `find-here-links-3'
======================
Suppose that you are in a buffer with something interesting -
\"here\" -, and you want to generate a hyperlink to it and copy
that hyperlink to your notes. Some terminology:

  1. The target of that hyperlink will be the \"here\" buffer, so
     let's call the \"here\" buffer the \"target buffer\" from
     now on.

  2. `find-here-links' creates a temporary buffer with several
     elisp hyperlinks - let's call that buffer the \"elinks
     buffer\".

  3. Beginners start by putting all their (executable) notes in a
     single file, \"~/TODO\"; remember that `M-1 M-j' jumps to
     that file. The \"notes buffer\" is a buffer visiting the
     file \"~/TODO\".

The key sequence `M-h M-3' saves the current window configuration
in a variable called `ee-window-configuration-before-M-h-M-3',
creates a 3-window setting like this,

   _____________________
  |          |          |
  |          |  elinks  |
  |          |  buffer  |
  |  target  |__________|
  |  buffer  |          |
  |          |  notes   |
  |          |  buffer  |
  |__________|__________|

and puts the cursor at the elinks buffer.




5. `find-here-links-1'
======================
After creating the three windows described above we will usually
want to select a line from the elinks buffer - the right one,
i.e., the one with a hyperlink to the target buffer - and copy it
to the notes buffer; the next section explains how to do this.

After copying the hyperlink - or after deciding that we don't
want to copy it - we want to restore the original window
configuration that we had before typing `M-h M-3'. We can do that
by typing `M-h M-1' (`find-here-links-1'); I chose to use the
suffix \"1\" because in most cases the original window
configuration has a single window with the target buffer in it,
and the \"1\" is a reference to this:

  (find-emacs-keys-intro \"6. Windows\" \"C-x 1\")

Note that `M-h M-1' undoes what `M-h M-3' did. In a figure:

   _______________           _____________________           ________________ 
  |               |	    |          |          |	    |                |
  |               |	    |          |  elinks  |	    |                |
  |               | 	    |          |  buffer  |	    |                |
  |    target     | M-h M-3 |  target  |__________| M-h M-1 |     target     |
  |    buffer     | ------> |  buffer  |          | ------> |     buffer     |
  |               |	    |          |  notes   |	    |                |
  |               |	    |          |  buffer  |	    |                |
  |_______________|	    |__________|__________|	    |________________|




6. Copying the hyperlink
========================
When you are a beginner, the easiest way to copy an elisp
hyperlink from the elinks buffer to the notes buffer is to put
the cursor on the line with the hyperlink, then type `M-h M-w'
(`ee-copy-this-line-to-kill-ring'), and then go to the notes
buffer and copy it to there with `C-y' or with the entry \"Edit
-> Paste\" in the menu bar. Note that in the three-window setting
copying a hyperlink from the elinks buffer to the notes buffer
means copying it from the upper right window to the lower right
window:

   _____________________
  |          |          |
  |          |  elinks  |
  |          |  buffer  |
  |  target  |____||____|
  |  buffer  |    \\/    |
  |          |  notes   |
  |          |  buffer  |
  |__________|__________|

When you become a slightly more advanced user the easiest way is
the one with the key sequences described here:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"5.2. Cutting and pasting\")




7. Refining your hyperlinks
===========================
After learning the technique above, that was based on the keys:

  M-h M-3  -- find-here-links-3
  M-h M-w  -- ee-copy-this-line-to-kill-ring
  C-y      -- yank, i.e., paste; see: (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")
  M-h M-1  -- find-here-links-1

The next steps are to learn how:

  a) Refine hyperlinks. See:

       (find-refining-intro \"1. Pos-spec-lists\")
       (find-refining-intro \"2. Refining hyperlinks\")

  b) Work with a single window. See:

       (find-refining-intro \"3. Three buffers\")

  c) Use other keys that create buffers with hyperlinks. See:

       (find-emacs-keys-intro \"Some other keys that create\")

This buffer is _temporary_ and _editable_.
It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.



This tutorial supposes that you already know how to
create \"hyperlinks to here\" - see:
  (find-here-links-intro)
  (find-emacs-keys-intro \"and refining them\")




1. Pos-spec-lists
=================
Most hyperlinks functions defined by eev can be \"refined\" by
the addition of extra arguments. These extra arguments are called
a \"pos-spec\" (or a \"pos-spec-list\") and they specify a
position in the target buffer. The first argument means a certain
line number, when it is a number, or the first occurrence of a
certain string, when it is a string. Try:

  (find-enode \"Command Index\")
  (find-enode \"Command Index\" \"eval-last-sexp\")

Further arguments mean either \"move down n lines\" or \"search
for the next occurrence of a string\", depending on whether they
are numbers or strings. Try:

  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\" \"9\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\" 2)

In most cases an empty pos-spec-list, like this,

  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\")

means: \"if the target buffer already exists then just open it\"
- so that following that hyperlink would jump to the current
position of the point in that buffer.

Pos-spec-lists are usually interpreted by the function
`ee-goto-position'. The first argument is interpreted in a
special way, according to its type:

    string -> jump to the first occurrence of
              that string in the buffer
    number -> jump to the n-th line

and the other arguments are interpreted (recursively) by
`ee-goto-rest':

    string -> jump to the next occurence of that string
    number -> move down n lines
    list   -> evaluate the list

Here is an example in which one of the arguments is a list.
Suggestion: execute it with `M-2 M-e'.

  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\" \"9\" '(eek \"!!!\"))

There are some variants of `ee-goto-position' in which the first
argument is interpreted in a different way, but we will not
discuss them here. See:

  (find-efunction 'ee-goto-anchor)
  (find-eev \"eev-pdflike.el\" \"ee-goto-position-page\")

If you want to add support for more complex pos-spec-lists, just
replace `ee-goto-rest' with your own extended version.




2. Refining hyperlinks
======================
To _refine_ a hyperlink means to add items to its pos-spec-list
to make it point to a more precise location. For example, in the
links below the first one points to an \"intro\", the second
points to a section in it, and the third points to an important
idea in that section:

  (find-escripts-intro)
  (find-escripts-intro \"5. Tools for writing e-scripts\")
  (find-escripts-intro \"5. Tools for writing e-scripts\" \"alternate\")

The paragraph where the word \"alternate\" is talks about how to
alternate between a \"task\" and \"taking notes\" without losing
focus on the \"task\". Eev has some keys sequences for doing
that:

  M-h M-h   - `find-here-links'. See: (find-eev-quick-intro \"`M-h M-h'\")
  M-h M-2   - `ee-duplicate-this-line'
  M-h M-y   - `ee-yank-pos-spec'
  M-h M-w   - `ee-copy-this-line-to-kill-ring'

Let me explain them starting by the two middle ones. This sexp

  (kill-new \"Tools for\")

puts the string \"Tools for\" on the top of the kill ring; we can
use it to simulate what happens when the user marks a region
containing that string and runs `M-w'. See:

  (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")
  (find-emacs-keys-intro \"3. Cutting & pasting\")

Try the first two sexps below:

  (kill-new \"Tools for\")
  (eek \"<down>  M-h M-2  M-h M-y\")
  (find-escripts-intro)

The `eek' duplicates the line with \"(find-escripts-intro)\" and
then runs `M-h M-y' (`ee-yank-pos-spec') on it; `M-h M-y' is
based on `C-y' (`yank'),

  (find-enode \"Yanking\")

but `M-h M-y' \"yanks\" the text at the end of the sexp, in
quotes, as an new argument.




3. Three buffers
================
One very common usage pattern involves three buffers:

  1. a buffer where we are storing our notes (the \"notes
     buffer\").

  2. a buffer with something interesting that we want to create a
     link to (the \"target buffer\"),

  3. a temporary buffer with editable hyperlinks, usually created
     by `find-here-links' (the \"elinks buffer\").

Usually beginners use the file \"~/TODO\" - that can be accessed
with `M-1 M-j' - for all the e-script notes that they create;
learning to keep notes in several files is a skill that comes
later.

Let's take a concrete example. We found something interesting in
section 4 of `(find-escripts-intro)', and we want to keep a link
to that; we decided to use the string \"snip, snip\" to refine
the hyperlink -

  (find-escripts-intro)
  (find-escripts-intro \"4. How to read an e-script\")
  (find-escripts-intro \"snip, snip\")

and we want to produce the refined hyperlink - using the keys
from the previous section -, copy it to our notes buffer, and go
back to the target buffer. The keys to switch buffers are shown
below,

   ________           ________           ________           ________
  |        |         :        :         |        |         |        |
  | target | M-h M-h : elinks : M-1 M-j | notes  | M-K M-K | target |
  | buffer | ------> : buffer : ------> | buffer | ------> | buffer |
  |________|         :________:         |________|         |________|

but there are also some things that we need to do inside each one
of these buffers:

  a. In the target buffer: mark the string \"snip, snip\" and
     copy it to the kill ring with `M-w' (`kill-ring-save');

  b. In the elinks buffer: go to the line with the hyperlink that
     points to the target buffer - `(find-escripts-intro)' -,
     refine it with `M-h M-2 M-h M-y', copy its line to the kill
     ring with `M-h M-w' (`ee-copy-this-line-to-kill-ring');

  c. In the notes buffer: insert the refined hyperlink with
     `C-y' (`yank').

Note: `M-h M-w' (`ee-copy-this-line-to-kill-ring') is a key
sequence intended for beginners. I prefer to use something like
`C-a shift-<down> M-w'.




4. A tip for beginners
======================
TODO: Rewrite this section! It was mostly superseded by:

  (find-here-links-intro \"4. `find-here-links-3'\")

Some people find the instructions above hard to follow because
they force them to remember lots of things that are off-screen.
If you run the second sexp below,

  (define-key eev-mode-map \"\\M-h\\M-h\" 'find-here-links)
  (define-key eev-mode-map \"\\M-h\\M-h\" 'find-here-links-beginner)

it will rebind the key sequence `M-h M-h' to a variant of
`find-here-links' for beginners that creates this window
configuration when invoked as `M-3 M-h M-h':

   _____________________
  |          |          |
  |          |  elinks  |
  |          |  buffer  |
  |  target  |__________|
  |  buffer  |          |
  |          |  notes   |
  |          |  buffer  |
  |__________|__________|

You can then try to run the instructions in the last section with
all the three buffers visible, switching from one buffer to
another by clicking on their windows. Note that the order is:

   _____________________
  |          |          |
  |         ==> elinks  |
  |          |  buffer  |
  |  target  |____||____|
  |  buffer  |    \\/    |
  |          |  notes   |
  |         <== buffer  |
  |__________|__________|

and note also that, in the terminology of

  (find-escripts-intro \"alternate\" \"task\" \"notes\")

the left side is \"task\" and the right side is \"notes\".

To rebind `M-h M-h' to its original function, run this:

  (define-key eev-mode-map \"\\M-h\\M-h\" 'find-here-links)

or restart Emacs.

It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.



Note: this intro needs to be rewritten!
Ideally it should _complement_ the material in:
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"2. Evaluating Lisp\")




1. The standard way to evaluate Lisp: `C-x C-e'
===============================================
The most important idea in Emacs is that Lisp code can appear
anywhere, and you can evaluate a Lisp expression (a \"sexp\") by
placing the cursor (the \"point\") just after it and typing `C-x
C-e'; the result is then displayed in the echo area. Try it in
the line below, with the point in the three different indicated
positions - you should get different results.

  (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))
            ^       ^^
            |       | \\
            6      20  26



2. The end of line and `M-e'
============================
A common operation is to move the point to the end of the current
line, then run `C-x C-e'. That can be done with `C-e C-x C-e',
but eev-mode implements a shorthand for it: `M-e'. Try it here:

  (+ (* 2 3)
     (* 4 5)
     )

`M-e' accepts several different numeric prefixes that alter its
behavior. We are only interested in one of them now - `M-0 M-e'
highlights the sexp for a fraction of a second insted of
executing it. Try it above.

In some rare occasions we might want to run something like `M-e'
but without moving to the end of the line first. Eev-mode
implements a key binding for that: `M-E' (meta-shift-e). As an
exercise, try to use `M-0 M-E' at several positions below, to
hightlight the subsexps `(* 2 3)', `(* 4 5)', and `4'.

  (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))





3. What to execute, and in what order
=====================================
Note that the order of evaluation may be important:

  (setq a 5)
  (setq a 6)
  (* a a)

By executing `(setq a 5)' and then `(* a a)' above we get 25,
by executing `(setq a 6)' and then `(* a a)' we get 36 - the
current value of `a' is the one of the last `setq' executed.

An exercise: edit the three sexps above to introduce a
`(setq a 22)', then use that sexp and the `(* a a)' to calculate
the square of 22.

Another exercise: just as `setq' sets variables and can override
their previous values, `defun' defines, and redefines, functions.
Execute the sexps below in different orders to obtain the results
25, 36, 50, and 60.

  (setq a 5)
  (setq a 6)
  (defun f (x) (* x x))
  (defun f (x) (* x 10))
  (f a)

MORAL: Elisp code can appear anywhere in any Emacs buffer, but it
is _passive by default_. It only gets executed if we move the
point to the right positions and type `C-x C-e', `M-e', or
similar keys. Sexps can be executed any number of times, in any
order, and can be edited and modified.




4. Elisp hyperlinks
===================
Some Emacs functions can be used as hyperlinks. When sexps like

  (find-file \"/tmp/\")
  (info \"(emacs)Lisp Eval\")
  (describe-function 'find-file)
  (find-function     'find-file)
  (man \"cat\")

are executed they \"open a new page\" - actually, they create a
new buffer, or reuse it if it already exists - and it is usually
possible to \"go back\" by killing the new buffer. However for
some functions, like `man', which by default open a manpage in
another window, \"going back\" would mean something different.

Eev defines several functions to let us use sexps as hyperlinks.
The main conventions on these functions are:

  1) their names start with \"find-\",

  2) calls to them can be \"refined\" with a pos-spec (this will
     be discussed below),

  3) they open the new buffer in the current window (to make it
     easier to \"go back\" after following them - see the next
     section),

  4) they don't display much output in the echo area,

  5) when they create temporary buffers with lots of sexps then:

     a) the first sexp in that buffer is one that can regenerate
        that buffer when executed,

     b) all the sexps are prefixed with the string stored in the
        variable `ee-hyperlink-prefix', to let these sexps be
        pasted into scripts as comments (see below).

Note that sometimes the most obvious name for a hyperlink
function starting with `find-' is already taken by Emacs - for
example, `find-file' and `find-function'. In those cases eev use
other names: `find-fline', `find-efunction', etc. Here are the
eev versions of the links above:

  (find-fline \"/tmp/\")
  (find-node \"(emacs)Lisp Eval\")
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)
  (find-efunction      'find-file)
  (find-man \"cat\")




5. Going back
=============
Web browsers let you follow a hyperlink and then \"go back\".
There are different ways of going back - if you opened the new
page on a new window or tab, then going back means deleting the
new window or tab (or just switching to the old window/tab); if
you opened the new page on the same window/tab, then you need to
use the \"back\" button.

Eev-mode defines two keys for \"going back\": `M-k', that kills
the current buffer, and `M-K', that just hides it (\"buries\" it
in the bottom of the list of all buffers). Try following the link
below by <M-e>, then deleting its buffer with `M-k' to go back:

  (find-node \"(emacs)Shell\")

In some cases we know that we may want to go \"forward\" again
after going back, and we may not want to delete the target buffer
- for example, because it would take a while to rebuild it again,
or because we would lose the position of the point there. Most
hyperlink functions in eev are able to reuse a buffer that
\"looks like\" the desired target buffer; the test for
lookalikeness is based on the name of the buffer only. Try to
follow the links below with `M-e', then come back to this buffer
with `M-k', then follow them again. Then try the same thing with
`M-K' instead of `M-k', to see the difference - in the `find-sh'
example below the \"sleep\" takes one second to run, so
revisiting the existing output buffer after a `M-K' is much
quicker than recreating it anew.

  (find-man \"1 bash\")
  (find-sh \"sleep 1; echo 'This was run at:'; date\")




6. Refining hyperlinks
======================
Note: this, and some of the following sections, were rewritten
and moved to:

  (find-refining-intro \"1. Pos-spec-lists\")
  (find-refining-intro \"2. Refining hyperlinks\")

Most hyperlinks functions defined by eev can be \"refined\" by
the addition of extra arguments. These extra arguments are called
a \"pos-spec\" (or a \"pos-spec-list\") and they specify a
position in the target buffer. The first argument means a certain
line number, when it is a number, or the first occurrence of a
certain string, when it is a string. Try:

  (find-node \"(emacs)Command Index\")
  (find-node \"(emacs)Command Index\" \"eval-last-sexp\")

Further arguments mean either \"move down n lines\" or \"search
for the next occurrence of a string\", depending on whether they
are numbers or strings. Try:

  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\" \"9\")
  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\" 2)



7. Pos-spec-lists
=================
The optional arguments that refine a hyperlink form what we call
a \"pos-spec-list\". For example, the pos-spec-list here has two
elements,

  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\" \"2100\" \"9\")

and in most cases an empty pos-spec-list, like this,

  (find-sh \"seq 2095 2115\")

means: \"if the target buffer already exists then just open it\"
- so that following that hyperlink would jump to the current
position of the point in that buffer.

Pos-spec-lists are usually interpreted by the function
`ee-goto-position'. The first argument is interpreted in a
special way, according to its type:

    string -> jump to the first occurrence of
              that string in the buffer
    number -> jump to the n-th line

and the other arguments are interpreted (recursively) by
`ee-goto-rest':

    string -> jump to the next occurence of that string
    number -> move down n lines
    list   -> evaluate the list

If you want to add support for more complex pos-spec-lists, just
replace `ee-goto-rest' with your own extended version.



8. Anchors and pages
====================
\[See:\] (find-anchors-intro)

Some hyperlink functions, like `find-efunction' and
`find-evariable', jump to specific positions in buffers - the
beginning of the definition of a function or a variable in the
source code - even when their pos-spec-lists are empty, so they
process all their extra arguments with just `ee-goto-rest'.

Other hyperlink functions transform the first argument of a
pos-spec-list in a special way it if is a string - for example,
in `find-available', which is based on `find-Package',

  (find-available \"bash\")
  (find-available \"bash\" \"bash-doc\")

the argument \"bash\" is converted to \"\\nPackage: bash\\n\",
and the two hyperlinks above jump to the description of the
package \"bash\" in the list of the available packages in a
Debian system.

The functions based on `find-anchor' transform an initial string
argument in the pos-spec-list by running `ee-format-as-anchor' on
it [TODO: document this], and the ones based on
`ee-goto-position-page' jump to the n-th \"page\" of a buffer if
the first argument of the pos-spec-list is a number, n; for
exemple, if n is 234 that will jump to the 233-th formfeed (233
and not 234 because the page 1 is before the first formfeed). For
more on \"pages\", see:

  (find-pdf-like-intro \"PDF-like documents as text\")




9. Producing and refining hyperlinks
====================================
If you are on an Info page, typing `M-h M-i' will create a
temporary buffer containing a header - which we will discuss
later - and several (possibly equivalent) links to that info
page. Something like this:
   ________________________________________________________
  |;; (find-einfo-links)                                   |
  |                                                        |
  |;; (info \"(emacs)Misc Buffer\")                          |
  |;; (find-node \"(emacs)Misc Buffer\")                     |
  |;; (find-enode \"Misc Buffer\")                           |
  |                                                        |
  |                                                        |
  |--:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L1     (Fundamental)---|
  |________________________________________________________|

These links are meant to be cut & pasted - possibly after
refining them to make them more precise. Let's look first at the
two key sequences that make refining much easier. Remember that
`M-w' (`kill-ring-save') is roughly correspondent to what is
called \"copy\" is most modern interfaces, and `C-y' (`yank') is
roughly correspondent to \"paste\". Both `M-w' and `C-y' operate
on Emacs's \"kill ring\", and to make our examples trivial to
follow we will first put a string on the kill ring:

  (kill-new \"C-y\")
  (car kill-ring)

Now let's see how to refine hyperlinks quickly. `M-h M-2'
duplicates the current line; we will use that to refine a copy of
a working hyperlink, instead of working directly on the original,
and risking breaking it. And `M-h M-y' refines the hyperlink on
the current line by adding a string - the top element in the kill
ring - to its sexp. Try this below; you should be able to convert

  (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")
  (find-enode \"Yanking\")

into

  (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")
  (find-enode \"Kill Ring\" \"C-y\")
  (find-enode \"Yanking\")
  (find-enode \"Yanking\" \"C-y\")

with few keystrokes, as you can leave the Meta key pressed. The
full key sequence for duplicating and refining is `M-h M-2 M-h
M-y', but we can think of it as `M-h2hy'.

Now try a more serious exercise: follow the `(find-enode ...)'
hyperlink below, copy a word or two from its contents to the kill
ring with `M-w', then generate the temporary buffer with
hyperlinks to that Info page with `M-h M-i', then duplicate one
of its hyperlinks with `M-h M-2', refine it with `M-h M-y', and
copy the result to this sandbox with `M-w' (or `C-w') and `C-y'.
As this is a long sequence of instructions, it is better to run
`C-x 1 C-x 2' or `C-x 1 C-x 3' before following the hyperlink, to
keep the instructions visible.

  (find-enode \"Command Index\")




10. More on functions
=====================
A symbol - for example `f' - can be both a varible and a
function; its \"value as a variable\" and its \"value as a
function\" are stored in different places. Try:

  (setq f 2)
  (setq f 5)
  (defun f (x) (* x x))
  (defun f (x) (* 10 x))
  (symbol-value    'f)
  (symbol-function 'f)

This is explained here:

  (find-elnode \"Symbol Components\")
  (find-elnode \"Symbol Components\" \"value cell\")
  (find-elnode \"Symbol Components\" \"function cell\")

The content of a \"function cell\" is _usually_ a lambda
expression. See:

  (find-elnode \"Lambda Expressions\")
  (find-elnode \"What Is a Function\")
  (find-elnode \"What Is a Function\" \"lambda expression\")
  (find-elnode \"What Is a Function\" \"byte-code function\")

Try:

  (setq f 2)
  (setq f 5)
  (set 'f 2)
  (set 'f 5)
  (fset 'f (lambda (x) (* x x)))
  (fset 'f (lambda (x) (* 10 x)))
  (defun f (x) (* 10 x))
  (defun f (x) (* x x))
  (symbol-value    'f)
  (symbol-function 'f)
  (f 4)
  (f f)

  ((lambda (x) (* x x))
   4)
  ((lambda (x) (* 10 x))
   4)



10.1. Byte-compiled functions
-----------------------------
Most functions in Emacs are byte-compiled - which means that
their function cells contain a \"byte-code\" instead of a lambda
expression. These byte-codes are very hard for humans to read.
See:

  (find-elnode \"What Is a Function\" \"byte-code function\")
  (find-elnode \"Byte-Code Type\")
  (find-elnode \"Byte Compilation\")
  (find-elnode \"Disassembly\")

Here is an example:

  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)
  (find-efunction      'find-file)
  (symbol-function     'find-file)
  (find-efunctionpp    'find-file)
  (find-efunctiond     'find-file)

The `find-efunctionpp' link above takes the content of the
function cell of `find-file' and \"pretty-prints\" it, i.e.,
indents it in a nice way, but the result in this case is
unreadable... and the `find-efunctiond' link shows a decompiled
version of that byte-code, which is only slightly better. Both
the `find-efunctionpp' and the `find-efunctiond' links show
internal representations that are very different from the source
code. Compare that with a case in which the function is not
byte-compiled:

  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-fline)
  (find-efunction      'find-fline)
  (symbol-function     'find-fline)
  (find-efunctionpp    'find-fline)

The `(find-efunctionpp 'find-fline)' shows a lambda expression
that is very similar to the defun that defined `find-fline'.




10.2. How `find-efunction' works
--------------------------------
Eev defines hyperlink functions called `find-efunction',
`find-evariable' and `find-eface' that are wrappers around the
standard functions `find-function', `find-variable' and
`find-face-definition'; the eev variants support pos-spec-lists.
Try:

  (find-efunction 'find-fline)
  (find-function  'find-fline)
  (find-evariable 'ee-hyperlink-prefix)
  (find-variable  'ee-hyperlink-prefix)
  (find-eface           'eepitch-star-face)
  (find-face-definition 'eepitch-star-face)

The Emacs functions are defined here:

  (find-efile \"emacs-lisp/find-func.el\")

Their inner workings are quite complex. They use `symbol-file',
that works on the variable `load-history'. Here are some links to
documentation and tests:

  (find-efunctiondescr 'symbol-file)
  (find-elnode \"Where Defined\")
  (symbol-file 'find-fline          'defun)
  (symbol-file 'ee-hyperlink-prefix 'defvar)
  (symbol-file 'eepitch-star-face   'defface)
  (find-epp (assoc (locate-library \"eepitch\") load-history))

The functions in \"find-func.el\" use `symbol-file' to find the
file where a given symbol was defined, and then search a defun,
defvar of defface in it that _may be_ the definition that we are
looking for. The eev variants use the functions
`find-function-noselect', `find-variable-noselect' and
`find-definition-noselect' from \"find-func.el\", that return a
pair (BUFFER . POS). Try:

  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-function-noselect)
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-variable-noselect)
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-definition-noselect)

  (find-ebufferandpos (find-function-noselect 'find-fline)
   )
  (find-ebufferandpos (find-variable-noselect 'ee-hyperlink-prefix)
   )
  (find-ebufferandpos (find-definition-noselect 'eepitch-star-face 'defface)
   )

These `find-*-select' functions work quite well but are not 100%
reliable - for example, if an elisp file has several definitions
for the same function, variable, or face, the `find-*-select's
don't know which ones were executed, neither which one was
executed last, overriding the other ones... and it may return the
position of a defun, defvar, or defface that is not the
\"active\" one.




10.3. Why eev avoids byte-compilation
-------------------------------------
All the source files of eev have a \"no-byte-compile: t\" in
them. See:

  (find-eevgrep \"grep --color -nH -e no-byte-compile: *.el\")
  (find-elnode \"Byte Compilation\" \"no-byte-compile: t\")

This is non-standard, but it is a deliberate design choice.

(TODO: explain the three main reasons: it is easier to teach
emacs to beginners if they see lots of lambda expressions and few
byte-codes; `code-c-d' and friends define functions dynamically
and `find-efunction' don't work on them; in a distribution with
only the \".elc\"s of eev users wouldn't have access to the
documentation and examples in the comments of the source files.)





10.4. Quote and backquote
-------------------------
Eev uses backquote a lot and avoids macros.

  (find-elnode \"Backquote\")
  (find-elnode \"Macros\")






11. What else?
==============
Eev-mode defines several other key sequences similar to `M-h
M-i'. You can get the full list here:

  (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode)
  (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode \"M-h f\")

This intro explains some conventions on the names and behaviors
of the hyperlink functions of eev.





1. Security vs. transparency
============================
In a previous tutorial - here:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3. Elisp hyperlinks\")

we saw that several kinds of sexps can be used as hyperlinks. For
example, these ones:

  (find-fline \"/tmp/\")
  (find-node \"(emacs)Lisp Eval\")
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)
  (find-efunction      'find-file)
  (find-man \"cat\")

Hyperlinks in a web browser _usually_ take us to a different
page, or to a different position in the same page, and in those
cases it is possible to go back to previous position from there;
but sometimes hyperlinks - or webpage buttons - are associated to
Javascript code, and \"following the link\" then means executing
that code. Web browsers try to make it impossible to have
hyperlinks or webpages that will send out your private
information, or that will put your system in a unusable state.
Security is web browsers is achieved by restricting what the
scripts in a page can do.

Sexp hyperlinks, in contrast, can do essentially anything - and,
instead of _security_, they have _transparency_. The code that a
sexp hyperlink will execute is visible, and users are supposed to
know that sexp hyperlinks with `find-fline', `find-node',
`find-efunctiondescr', etc, are very safe - but the ones that
start with `find-sh' may not be. It is possible to write
something like:

  (find-sh \"<code that deletes all your e-mails>\")

but it is not possible to hide that action behind an
innocent-looking button that says \"click for a larger image\".

So, _any_ elisp sexp can be _used_ as a sexp hyperlink; but
people are only going to follow a sexp hyperlink if they can more
or less predict (quickly!) what that hyperlink is going to do...
Readability is important, so let's take a look at the most common
kinds of hyperlinks.




2. Learning to read hyperlinks
==============================
How can we learn to recognize what each hyperlink sexp does? And
which ones are safe(r), and which ones are not? How do we
classify all hyperlink sexps?

We can start by dividing the hyperlink functions into a fixed set
of \"basic\" ones and an unbounded set of \"non-basic\" ones. In
the buffer generated by

  (find-efunction-links 'find-file)

these hyperlinks

  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)
  (find-efunction 'find-file)
  (find-efunctionpp 'find-file)
  (find-efunctiond 'find-file)
  (find-estring (documentation 'find-file))
  (find-estring (documentation 'find-file t))
  (find-fline (symbol-file 'find-file 'defun))

calls \"basic\" eev hyperlink functions, that are just interfaces
to Emacs function slightly tweaked into functions that follow
eev's conventions - they are refinable, use the current window,
etc. But these two,

  (find-enode \"Command Index\" \"* find-file:\")
  (find-elnode \"Index\" \"* find-file:\")

are generated by calls to `code-c-d', as explained here:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\" \"find-code-c-d\")

Check:

  (find-code-c-d \"e\"  ee-emacs-lisp-directory :info \"emacs\")
  (find-code-c-d \"el\" ee-emacs-lisp-directory :info \"elisp\")

The `code-*' functions define hyperlink functions whose names are
of the form `find-{stem}{suffix}', and each of these `code-*'
function has an associated `find-code-*' function that just
displays what the corresponding `code-*' would execute. So one
way to get acquainted to the most common of these suffixes is to
follow these hyperlinks:

  (find-code-c-d      \"CODE\" \"/DIR/\" :info \"INFO\")
  (find-code-pdf-page \"CODE\" \"FILE.pdf\")
  (find-code-pdf-text \"CODE\" \"FILE.pdf\")
  (find-code-audio    \"CODE\" \"FILE\")
  (find-code-video    \"CODE\" \"FILE\")

From these only the functions whose suffixes end with \"sh\" or
\"sh0\" and inherently dangerous; the others are usually safe if
no hacks had been done.

Some hyperlinks functions - for example the ones created by
`code-pdf-page', `code-audio', etc - invoke external programs,
and _may_ behave in bad ways when given unsafe arguments; these
functions are implemented using the low-level functions
`find-bgprocess' and `find-callprocess', which of course are
unsafe too.

Also, the functions `find-*-links', `find-*-intro' and
`find-code-*' simply create temporary buffers, and are thus very
safe - but, as always, think carefully before executing any code
that they generate.




3. Classification
=================
Here's one way to classify the hyperlink functions defined by
eev. It's far from perfect, but that's how they are divided in
the source files.

We start from some observations:

  a) The functions `code-c-d', `code-pdf-page' and
     `code-pdf-text' define new hyperlink functions; we called
     these new hyperlink functions \"short(er) hyperlinks\".

  b) Functions like `find-efunction-links' create temporary
     buffers with hyperlinks using `find-elinks', that is
     described here:

       (find-eev \"eev-elinks.el\" \"find-elinks\")

  c) Functions like `find-latex-links' create temporary buffers
     with hyperlinks plus templated text; they use `find-elinks'
     and `ee-template0', that is described here:

       (find-eev \"eev-wrap.el\" \"ee-template0\")

  d) Functions like `find-sh' and `find-pdf-page' call external
     processes.

  e) `code-c-d' has a debugging function associated to it:
     `find-code-c-d', that shows the \"templated code\" that the
     corresponding `code-c-d' would execute. `code-pdf-page' has
     `find-code-pdf-page' as its associated debugging function,
     and so on.

  f) If we call the hyperlinks in the items above \"non-basic\"
     then we get - by exclusion! - a notion of what are \"basic
     hyperlinks\".

Here is the classification, with the class or idea at the left
and a hyperlink to the source file at the right:

  Basic hyperlinks:                 (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\")
  External processes:               (find-eev \"eev-plinks.el\")
  `find-elinks':                    (find-eev \"eev-elinks.el\")
  `find-elinks'+`ee-template0':     (find-eev \"eev-tlinks.el\")
  `code-c-d' and `find-code-c-d':   (find-eev \"eev-code.el\")
  `code-pdf*' and `find-code-pdf*': (find-eev \"eev-pdflike.el\")





4. Elisp hyperlinks: some conventions
=====================================
One of the main ideas of eev is that elisp hyperlinks can be
\"followed\" with `M-e', and we can _usually_ \"go back\" with `M-k'.
We saw a few cases where `M-k' didn't work for going back:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3. Elisp hyperlinks\" \"eek\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3. Elisp hyperlinks\" \"find-sh0\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"8.1. Introduction: `to'\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.3. Hyperlinks to PDF files\" \"find-pdf-page\")

Emacs has several functions that _sort_ of can be used as hyperlinks,
but that are kind of messy. For example, this one

  (man \"cat\")

may split the current window or even create another frame, and this
one

  (describe-function 'find-file)

displays a lot of output in the echo area. Compare them with their
eev-ish variants:

  (find-man \"cat\")
  (find-man \"cat\" \"-n, --number\")
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)
  (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file \"RET\")

They:

  1) Have names that start with \"find-\" to indicate that they are from
     eev (practically all functions and variables defined in eev start
     with the prefixes \"find-\" or \"ee\"),

  2) they open the new buffer in the current window (to make it
     easier to go back),

  3) they don't display much output in the echo area,

  4) calls to them can be \"refined\" with a pos-spec.




4.1. Conventions on hyperlinks buffers
--------------------------------------
Emacs has several help commands, whose bindings start with `C-h',
that display their information in (temporary) \"help buffers\" -
and in many cases these help buffers have hyperlinks, that can be
followed by typing <RET> on them. They are explained here:

  (find-enode \"Help\")

An example:

  (find-enode \"Key Help\")
  (eek \"C-h k <down>\")

Eev has something similar, but using the prefix `M-h' and
following very different design decisions. Let's start with a
comparison, between Emacs's `C-h f' (`describe-function') and
eev's `M-h M-f' (`find-efunction-links'). Try:

  \"C-h f   find-file\" -> (describe-function    'find-file)
  \"C-h f   find-file\" -> (find-efunctiondescr  'find-file)
  \"M-h M-f find-file\" -> (find-efunction-links 'find-file)

`describe-function' and `find-efunctiondescr' are similar, but
the second one is better for use with `M-e'; we saw the reasons
in the previous section. `C-h f find-file' produces a buffer with
readable text and \"usual\" hyperlinks that can be followed by
typing RET on them, while `M-h M-f find-file' produces a buffer
like this:

   _____________________________________________________________ 
  |# (find-efunction-links 'find-file)                          |
  |# (where-is 'find-file)                                      |
  |# (describe-function 'find-file)                             |
  |# (find-efunctiondescr 'find-file)                           |
  |# (find-efunction 'find-file)                                |
  |# (find-efunctionpp 'find-file)                              |
  |# (find-efunctiond 'find-file)                               |
  |# (find-estring (documentation 'find-file))                  |
  |# (find-estring (documentation 'find-file t))                |
  |# (symbol-file 'find-file 'defun)                            |
  |# (find-fline (symbol-file 'find-file 'defun))               |
  |                                                             |
  |# (Info-goto-emacs-command-node 'find-file)                  |
  |# (find-enode \"Command Index\" \"* find-file:\")                |
  |# (find-elnode \"Index\" \"* find-file:\")                       |
  |                                                             |
  |                                                             |
  | -:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L1     (Fundamental)  ------|
  |_____________________________________________________________|

that looks very cryptic at first. It has lots of elisp
hyperlinks, some of them starting with \"find-\" and following
the conventions explained in section 2, some others not; some of
the sexps in it are easy to understand - try all of them! -,
while others are very technical.

This is an example of an \"elisp hyperlinks buffer\". The
functions that generate elisp hyperlinks buffers, like
`find-efunction-links', follow the convention (1)-(4) from
section 2 plus:

  5) The buffer name is \"*Elisp hyperlinks*\",

  6) The first sexp(s) in the elisp hyperlinks buffer regenerates
     the buffer,

  7) all the sexps are prefixed with the string stored in the
     variable `ee-hyperlink-prefix', to let these sexps be
     pasted into e-scripts as comments.

To understand the role of the first sexp let's look at the next
level of complexity.




4.2. Conventions on templated text
----------------------------------
Some functions, like `find-latex-links', generate buffers that
are composed of a series of elisp hyperlinks, as in the previous
section, followed by some \"templated text\". Try to execute the
two sexps below with `M-2 M-e':

  (find-latex-links)
  (find-latex-links \"/tmp/latextest\")
  (find-latex-links \"~/LATEX/foobar\")

Remember that `M-2 M-e' splits the window like this,
   __________ __________
  |          |          |
  |  source  |  target  |
  |          |          |
  |__________|__________|

where the \"source buffer\" is this one and the \"target buffer\" will be
this in the first case,
   ___________________________________________________________________ 
  |# (find-latex-links \"{stem}\")                                      |
  |# (find-latex-links \"/tmp/test\")                                   |
  |# (find-eev-quick-intro \"`find-latex-links'\")                      |
  |# (ee-copy-rest 1 '(find-fline \"{stem}.tex\"))                      |
  |                                                                   |
  |% (defun c () (interactive) (find-sh \"pdflatex {stem}.tex\"))       |
  |% (defun d () (interactive) (find-pdf-page \"{stem}.pdf\"))          |
  |% (defun e () (interactive) (find-fline    \"{stem}.tex\"))          |
  |% (defun w () (interactive) (find-texworks \"{stem}.tex\"))          |
  |%                                                                  |
  |\\documentclass{article}                                            |
  |\\begin{document}                                                   |
  |                                                                   |
  |\\end{document}                                                     |
  |                                                                   |
  |                                                                   |
  | -:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L1     (Fundamental)  ------------|
  |___________________________________________________________________|

In the second case all the \"{stem}\"s are substituted by
\"/tmp/latextest\", and in the third case they are substituted by
\"~/LATEX/foobar\". If you execute the second sexp in that
buffer, that is,

  # (find-latex-links \"/tmp/test\")

you get the buffer with the \"{stem}\"s substituted by \"/tmp/test\".

We can think that `find-latex-links' generates an \"*Elisp
hyperlinks*\" buffer from a template that depends on an argument
`stem', and:

  1) when `stem' is nil it is set to \"{stem}\",

  2) the first sexp corresponds to how `find-latex-links' was
     called (after the substitution of nils above),

  3) the second sexp shows a typical, useful, value for `stem',

  4) we can edit by hand the `stem's in the `find-latex-links'
     sexps in first two lines, and run them to regenerate the
     buffer with the new, hand-edited values.



4.3. Elisp hyperlinks buffers vs. Help buffers
----------------------------------------------
Let's refer to Emacs's help buffers as \"C-h buffers\" and to
eev's elisp hyperlink buffers as \"M-h buffers\". Here is a quick
list of the main differences and conventions; some of them will
be expanded later:

  1) C-h buffers are usually named \"*Help*\", while
     M-h buffers are usually named \"*Elisp Hyperlinks*\";

  2) C-h buffers are generated by functions called \"describe-*\",
     M-h buffers are generated by functions called \"find-*-links\";

  3) C-h buffers may contain \"usual-looking\" links, that can be
     followed by typing RET on them, and this is implemented via
     \"buttons\"; C-h buffers are \"ascii plus text properties\",
     while M-h buffers are plain ascii;

  4) C-h buffers are read-only, while
     M-h buffers are read-and-write. The idea is that we can not
     only follow the hyperlinks in a M-h buffer but also modify
     them - usually by \"refining\" them, like this,

       (find-eval-intro \"Refining hyperlinks\")

     then test the modified versions, and copy-and-paste those
     hyperlinks to other, more permanent places. This is much
     easier to do when we are working in plain ascii; the buttons
     in C-h buffers are non-trivial to create, to edit and to
     save.

  5) C-h buffers are _readable_, while
     M-h buffers may look like (technical) gibberish.

     This is intentional - M-h buffers have a do-it-yourself,
     \"I'm the result of a 5-minute hack\" feeling because most
     of them started just like that, as 5-minute hacks that
     turned out to be useful enough, and only suffered very minor
     changes later on. Try this:

       (find-find-links-links)

     Most `find-*-links' were created from that template - and it
     should be easy to create other ones.

  5) Many `M-h' commands, like `M-h f' and `M-h M-i', generate
     sexp hyperlinks that \"point to where we are now\"; but once
     we are in an M-h buffer this idea - whose basis is:
     from (almost) anywhere in Emacs it should to be easy to
     create a hyperlink to where we are now - changes to:

  6) The first line (the \"top sexp\") of an M-h buffer
     regenerates the buffer. And, at last,

  7) The elisp hyperlinks in M-h buffers are prefixed by the
     string in `ee-hyperlink-prefix'.

It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.



Note: this intro is being rewritten!
Ideally it should _complement_ the material in:
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3. Elisp hyperlinks\")








1. Functions for templated text
===============================
The function that is used to generate templated text from a
string is called `ee-template0'. The function that generates a
templated text from a list of sexps and strings is called
`ee-links-to-string'. The function that generates an \"*Elisp
hyperlinks*\" buffer from a list of sexps and strings is called
`find-elinks'. They are explained, with examples, in the source
code, at:

  (find-eev \"eev-wrap.el\" \"ee-template0\")
  (find-eev \"eev-elinks.el\" \"find-elinks\")
  (find-eev \"eev-elinks.el\" \"find-elinks\" \"ee-links-to-string\")

Some functions like `find-latex-links' generate buffers with
elisp hyperlinks at the top, some templated text meant to be
saved to a file at the bottom, and with a call to `ee-copy-rest'
separating the top part from the bottom part. The `ee-copy-rest'
is explained in detail here:

  (find-eev \"eev-tlinks.el\" \"ee-copy-rest\")




2. `find-here-links'
====================
The most important of the commands that generates buffers with elisp
hyperlinks - \"M-h commands\", in the terminology explained above - is
`find-here-links', which integrates most of the functionalities of
several more basic M-h commands. We will explain first what it _does_,
then its _usage_.

`find-here-links' is bound to `M-h M-h' to make it very easy to
invoke. If you are reading this then \"here\" means the buffer
\"*(find-links-intro)*\", in a certain position. Try to type `M-h M-h';
you will get a buffer like this,

   ____________________________________________________________
  |# See:                                                      |

  |# (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode \"M-h M-h\")                 |
  |                                                            |
  |# (find-links-intro)                                        |

  |--:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L1     (Fundamental eev)  -|
  |____________________________________________________________|

which contains a 3-line header with help links, that we will explain
soon, and then a link to \"here\", i.e., to the buffer
\"*(find-links-intro)*\". Note that the link

  (find-links-intro)

can be \"refined\" to, for example,

  (find-links-intro \"which contains a 3-line header\")

using the tricks described in these sections:

  (find-eval-intro \"Refining hyperlinks\")
  (find-eval-intro \"Producing and refining hyperlinks\")
  (find-eval-intro \"Producing and refining hyperlinks\" \"`M-h M-2'\")
  (find-eval-intro \"Producing and refining hyperlinks\" \"`M-h2hy'\")

but `find-here-links' by itself only produces \"unrefined\" links - so
when we say that `find-here-links' produces links to \"here\" we mean
just \"to the current buffer\", not \"to the a certain position in the
current buffer\".

`find-here-links' works for several kinds of \"here\"s - it works for
intros like this one, for Info pages, for manpages, for files and
directories, for descriptions of Emacs functions and variables, and
for a few other cases. Try the sexps below:

  (find-here-links-test '(find-eval-intro))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-node \"(dir)Top\"))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-enode \"Lisp Eval\"))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-fline \"~/\"))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-eevfile \"eepitch.el\"))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-efunction 'ee-eval-last-sexp))

  (find-here-links-test '(find-efunctiondescr 'ee-eval-last-sexp))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-evardescr      'ee-hyperlink-prefix))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-efacedescr     'eepitch-star-face))

  (find-here-links-test '(find-ecolors \"\\nred\"))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-efaces  \"eepitch-star-face\"))
  (find-here-links-test '(find-customizegroup 'rcirc))

  (find-here-links-test '(find-man \"1 cat\"))
   [^ oops, this test doesn't work on multi-window settings...]

Each one of them tests a different case of `find-here-links',
creating a window setup like this:

  |               |   [target of sexp]   |
  |_______________|______________________|

The cursor is kept at the left window (\"this intro\"), so you
can compare the different cases using just <up>, <down>, and M-e.




3. `find-here-links': usage patterns
====================================
Typically what happens is this. We are putting our notes - eepitch
blocks, hyperlinks, etc - in a certain file; let's refer to it as the
\"e-script\". Then we start to navigate for information, and we find
something interesting. We want to add a link pointing to that
\"something interesting\" to our e-script notes - but for that we need
to produce that sexp hyperlink, and ideally we would like to do that
in a way that does not disturb much our attention. Consider this
diagram [note: it DOES NOT imply that the Emacs frame is split into three
windows - typically we will switch between buffers in a single window]:

   ______________________________________ 
  |               |                      |
  |               |      something       |
  |              ==>    interesting      |
  |   e-script    |_________||___________|
  |               |         \\/           |
  |               |  result of running   |
  |              <== find-here-links on  |
  |               |   [sthing intrstng]  |
  |_______________|______________________|

and this series of steps:

  0. We start navigating from the e-script buffer, and when we
  1. find something interesting [in another buffer], we
  2. run `find-here-links' at the \"something interesting\" buffer,
  3. identify among the sexps in the find-here-links buffer one that
     points to that \"something interesting\",
  4. copy that sexp to the kill-ring,
  5. go back to the e-script buffer,
  6. insert that sexp into the e-script buffer,
  7. execute that sexp to go back to the \"something interesting\",
  8. continue navigating & doing stuff.

At (8) we are essentially back to (1), but we have added to our
e-script buffer a link to \"something interesting\". 

Note that to add refining we need to add a step before (2) and
another one after (3):

  1.9. select a string to search for and copy it to the kill-ring,
  3.1. refine that sexp using the \"string to search for\" (with M-h2hy)

\[TO DO: explain the keys that I normally use to perform all
this; explain why I am not the right person to optimize these
steps - because I can type these key sequences without thinking,
and step (3) sometimes gives several sexps for us to choose from]




4. ee-hyperlink-prefix
======================
`ee-hyperlink-prefix' is both a variable and a function that
helps us set that variable; it started to an experiment on how to
create an alternative to `M-x customize' and ended up becoming
the inspiration for all the `find-*-links' functions.

If you run `M-x ee-hyperlink-prefix' you should get a buffer like
this:

   ___________________________________________________________
  |# (ee-hyperlink-prefix)                                    |
  |# (setq ee-hyperlink-prefix \"# \")                          |
  |                                                           |
  |# (setq ee-hyperlink-prefix \"# \")                          |
  |# (setq ee-hyperlink-prefix \";; \")                         |
  |# (setq ee-hyperlink-prefix \"-- \")                         |
  |# (setq ee-hyperlink-prefix \"// \")                         |
  |# (setq ee-hyperlink-prefix \"% \")                          |
  |                                                           |
  |                                                           |
  |--:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L1     (Fundamental eev)--|
  |___________________________________________________________|

where the first line regenerates the buffer, the second line sets
the variable `ee-hyperlink-prefix' to its current value, and each
one of the lines after the first blank line sets
`ee-hyperlink-prefix' to one of several fixed common values. If
we change the value of `ee-hyperlink-prefix' with one of the
`setq's and execute the first line again we see that all the
prefixes, plus the argument \"# \" in the second line, change.
Try this, with `M-2 M-e' on each line:

  (progn (setq ee-hyperlink-prefix \"# \") (ee-hyperlink-prefix))
  (progn (setq ee-hyperlink-prefix \"% \") (ee-hyperlink-prefix))




5. The first line regenerates the buffer
========================================
Most of the \"M-h commands\" generate buffers with elisp
hyperlinks in which the the first line \"regenerates the
buffers\". This means two things:

  1. You can copy the first to your notes, and it will work as a
     link to that buffer. For example:

     (find-efunction 'next-line)
     (find-evariable 'line-move-visual)
     (find-latex-links \"/tmp/mytest\")
     (find-latex-links \"~/latextest\")
     (find-code-pdf-links \"/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/asymptote/\" \"{c}\")
     (find-code-pdf-links \"/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/asymptote/\" \"asy\")

     A good way to compare the results of the two
     `find-latex-links' and the two `find-code-pdf-links' sexps
     above is to run them with `M-2 M-e'. The prefix `M-2' to
     `M-e' makes the \"target\" of a sexp be displayed in a
     second window without switching to it. See:

       (find-efunctiondescr 'ee-eval-sexp-eol)
       (find-multiwindow-intro \"find-2a\")

  2. You can change the arguments of the sexp in the first line
     and run it again, and this will regenerate the buffer with
     some modifications. This was explained here:

     (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.5. `find-latex-links'\" \"change the \\\"{stem}\\\"\")
     (find-eev-quick-intro \"11.1. `find-pdf-links'\" \"adjust by hand\")

\[To do: explain how this works in more complex templates.
Example:\]

  (find-find-links-links)
  (find-find-links-links \"\\\\M-u\")
  (find-find-links-links \"\\\\M-u\" \"USERTEST\")
  (find-find-links-links \"\\\\M-u\" \"USERTEST\" \"a\")
  (find-find-links-links \"\\\\M-u\" \"USERTEST\" \"a b\")
  (find-find-links-links \"\\\\M-u\" \"USERTEST\" \"a b c\")




6. Pointing to where we are now
===============================
Several of the `M-h' commands are mainly meant to help us
generate hyperlinks to \"where we are now\": to the current file,
to the current Info page, to the current `find-*-intro', to an
Emacs function or variable we are inspecting, to the current
buffer, and so on. They don't try to be very smart -

\[To do: write this\]

  (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode)
  (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode \"M-h f\")

                                  (eek \"M-h M-i\")

         (find-enode \"Lisp Eval\")
  (progn (find-enode \"Lisp Eval\") (eek \"M-h M-i\"))

  (eek \"M-h f    ;; find-file-links\")
  (eek \"M-h M-b  ;; find-ebuffer-links\")

  for example, `M-h M-i' generates links to
     the current \"intro\" buffer - like this one - _and_ to the
     current Info page (the \"i\" in `M-h M-i' has two meanings).
     Try:

       (eek \"M-h M-i\")

     you should get something like this:

      ___________________________________________________________
     |# (find-einfo-links \"links\")                               |
     |                                                           |
     |[No \"*info*\" buffer]                                       |
     |                                                           |
     |# (find-links-intro)                                       |
     |                                                           |
     |                                                           |
     |--:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   All L1     (Fundamental eev)--|
     |___________________________________________________________|



7. The rest of the buffer
=========================
Several elisp hyperlinks buffers are composed of two parts: a
series of links at the top, and then a template-generated text
that is mean to be copied to somewhere else. The canonical
example is 

  (find-eev-update-links)

which ends with stuff that you can copy to your .emacs file to
make Emacs load eev by default. The end of the buffer generated
by `find-eev-update-links' looks more or less like this:

   ____________________________________________________________
  |# (ee-copy-rest 0 '(find-fline \"~/.emacs\"))                 |
  |                                                            |
  |;; Load eev2.                                               |
  |;; See:  (find-file \"~/eev/\")                               |
  |;;       (find-file \"~/eev/eev-readme.el\")                  |
  |;; Generated by: (find-eev-update-links \"~/eev/\")           |
  |;;                                                          |
  |(add-to-list 'load-path \"~/eev/\")                           |
  |(require 'eev2-all)      ; (find-eev \"eev2-all.el\")         |
  |(eev-mode 1)             ; (find-eev \"eev-mode.el\")         |
  |                                                            |
  |                                                            |
  |--:**-  *Elisp hyperlinks*   Bot L56    (Fundamental eev)---|
  |____________________________________________________________|

The line with `ee-copy-rest' is a hack. Its first argument is a
number, that we will call the \"skip\", and the second is
a (quoted) sexp hyperlink, that we will call the \"code\". The
rule that defines what is the \"rest of the buffer\" is this:

  Move to the beginning of the next line, then skip (i.e., move
  down) more SKIP lines. The rest of the buffer is everything
  from that point on.

A sexp like `(ee-copy-rest ...)' does several things:

  1) it highlights the rest of the buffer temporarily (like as
     with `M-0 M-e'),

  2) it copies the rest of the buffer to the kill ring (like as
     with `M-w'),

  3) it runs CODE to open its target in a window at the right
     side (like as with `M-3 M-e')

scripts etc\]

This intro _complements_ the material in:
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"6. Controlling shell-like programs\")

This (old) video shows a demo like the one in section 1.3:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_zKC5BR64&t=16s
The relevant part is from t=16s to t=25s.

In this intro we suppose that the reader knows what is a terminal
and what is a shell. In Unix-like systems the terminal and the
shell are clearly different programs, and it's easy to understand
how a terminal can be used to run other programs that are not
shells (e.g., a Python interpreter; see \"REPL\" below); in
Windows most people don't know that the \"DOS window\" is in fact
a Windows console running cmd.exe. Some links:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Console
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe





1. Some demos
=============
Let's start with the simplest case. If you put the cursor on the
first line that starts with a red star below and type the key
<f8> six times,

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo \"We are at: $PWD\"
cd /tmp/
echo \"We changed to: $(pwd)\"

you will notice that each <f8> does something with the current
line and move the cursor to the next line; first three <f8>s - on
the lines that start with red stars - create a window setting
like this,

   ________________________________
  |                |               |
  |     notes      |    target     |
  |     buffer     |    buffer     |
  |  (this intro)  |  (\"*shell*\")  |
  |                |               |
  |________________|_______________|
  
and the last three <f8>s - on \"non-red star lines\" - send the
lines

  echo \"We are at: $PWD\"
  cd /tmp/
  echo \"We changed to: $(pwd)\"

to the \"target buffer\", that in this case is the buffer with a
terminal running a shell; the shell behaves exactly is if the the
user had typed those three lines at its prompt.




1.1. Another target
-------------------
If you put the cursor at the first red star line below and type
<f8> six times you will get something very similar to the example
above,

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
1 + 2
print(\"Hello \" +
      \"world\")

but now the window setting will be like this:

   ________________________________
  |                |               |
  |     notes      |     target    |
  |     buffer     |     buffer    |
  |  (this intro)  |  (\"*python*\") |
  |                |               |
  |________________|_______________|

and the target buffer will be called \"*python*\", and it
contains a terminal running a Python interpreter.




1.2. Two targets
----------------
The demo below uses an advanced feature - the function
`find-3EE', explained at:

  (find-multiwindow-intro \"find-3EE\")

to create a 3-window setup like this:

   _______________________
  |          |            |
  |          |  *shell*   |
  |  notes   |____________|
  |  buffer  |            |
  |          |  *python*  |
  |__________|____________|

Some non-red star lines in it send the current line to the
\"*shell*\" buffer, and some send the current line to the
\"*python*\" buffer. The red star lines with \"(eepitch-shell)\"
set the target to \"*shell*\", and the red star lines with with
\"(eepitch-python)\" set the target to \"*python*\". Try it! Put
the cursor on the first red star line below, then type <f8>
twelve times:

 (find-3EE '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))
 (eepitch-shell)
echo Hello... > /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())

 (eepitch-shell)
echo ...and bye >> /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())




1.3. Two targets, two windows
-----------------------------
The demo below is similar to the one with three windows in the
previous section, but it uses just two windows - and the window
at the right alternates between \"*shell*\" and \"*python*\":

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo Hello... > /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())

 (eepitch-shell)
echo ...and bye >> /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())






2. How <f8> works
=================
The key <f8> works in one way when the cursor is on a line that
starts with a red star - it executes everything at the right of
the \"\" as Lisp code, and then moves down - and in a totally
different way on non-red star lines: on non-red star lines it
makes sure that the target buffer is being displayed, then sends
the current line to the target buffer \"as if the user had typed
it\", then moves down.




2.1. Eepitch blocks
-------------------
A block of three red star lines like

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)

or

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)

is called an \"eepitch block\". The _final effect_ of typing <f8>
thrice on an eepitch block like this

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)

is easy to describe: after the third <f8> we get a window setting
like this,

   ________________________
  |          |             |
  |  notes   |    target   |
  |  buffer  |    buffer   |
  |          | (\"*shell*\") |
  |          |             |
  |__________|_____________|

where the target buffer is running a _new_ shell...



2.2. `(eepitch-kill)'
---------------------
The effect of running <f8> on a line like

 (eepitch-kill)

is to kill the current target. More precisely, `(eepitch-kill)'
kills a buffer with the name stored in the variable
`eepitch-buffer-name', if a buffer with that name exists; in the
examples above the target buffer names are always either
\"*shell*\" or \"*python*\". If we are in a window setting like
this and the target is \"*shell*\"

   ________________________
  |          |             |
  |  notes   |    target   |
  |  buffer  |    buffer   |
  |          | (\"*shell*\") |
  |          |             |
  |__________|_____________|

and we run `(eepitch-kill)' the window setting becomes this:

   _____________________
  |          |          |
  |  notes   |   some   |
  |  buffer  |  other   |
  |          |  buffer  |
  |          |          |
  |__________|__________|

which may be confusing...




2.2. `(eepitch-shell)'
----------------------
The effect of running <f8> on a line like

 (eepitch-shell)

can be *roughly* described as:

  a) Set the name of the target buffer to \"*shell*\".

  b) If the target buffer does not exist, create it - by
     running `(shell)'.

  c) If the target buffer is not being display then display it -
     by creating a two-window setting with the target buffer at
     the right.

This is a simplification, though... the sexp

  (eepitch-shell)

runs this,

  (eepitch '(shell))

and the name of the target buffer is obtained from the
sexp `(shell)' by running it in a certain way.




2.3. `eepitch'
--------------
The documentation for `eepitch' says:

  (eepitch CODE)

  Set up a target for eepitch and make sure it is displayed in
  another window.
  The argument CODE must be a \"shell-like sexp\", i.e., one that
  when evaluated always switches to a buffer with a fixed name,
  and when that buffer does not exists it creates it.

For example, running `(shell)' switches to a buffer whose name is
\"*shell*\"; the name of the target buffer can obtained
from the sexp `(shell)' by running this:

  (save-window-excursion
    (shell)
    (setq eepitch-buffer-name
	  (buffer-name (current-buffer))))




2.4. `(eepitch-python)'
-----------------------
The effect of running <f8> on a line like

 (eepitch-python)

is very similar to `(eepitch-shell)', but it uses \"*python*\" as
the name of the target buffer. `(eepitch-python)' is defined as:

  (eepitch '(find-comintprocess \"python\" \"python\"))




2.5. `find-comintprocess'
-------------------------
The sexp

  (find-comintprocess \"buffer name\" \"program and args\")

switches to a buffer called \"*buffer name*\" and if that buffer
does not have an associated process then it runs \"program and
args\" there in comint mode.

The sexp

  (eepitch-comint \"buffer name\" \"program and args\")

works as an abbreviation for:

  (eepitch '(find-comintprocess \"buffer name\" \"program and args\"))

Most `eepitch-<lang>' functions are defined using
`eepitch-comint'. See:

  (find-eev \"eepitch.el\" \"eepitch-langs\")
  (find-eev \"eepitch.el\" \"find-comintprocess\")
  (find-eev \"eepitch.el\" \"find-comintprocess\" \"defun eepitch-comint \")




3. Test blocks
==============
Suppose that we have a file \"foo.py\" containing this (without
the indentation):

  def square (x):
      return x*x

  \"\"\"
   (eepitch-python)
   (eepitch-kill)
   (eepitch-python)
  execfile(\"foo.py\", globals())
  print(square(5))

  \"\"\"

Python treats everything between the first and the second
`\"\"\"'s as a multiline comment, and ignores it - but for us
this multiline comment contains an eepitch block that starts a
Python interpreter, then a line that loads \"foo.py\" in it, then
a line that tests the function \"square\" defined in foo.py. We
call the block between the `\"\"\"'s a \"test block\".

A \"test block\" is a multiline comment in a Python script, a Lua
script, or in a script in one of the other supported languages -
we call them the \"ambient script\" and the \"ambient language\"
- that contains at least:

  1) an eepitch block that runs an interpreter for the ambient
     language,

  2) a line that loads the ambient script in that interpreter,

  3) code that tests functions defined in the ambient script.

We can insert a test block in the current buffer by running `M-x
ee-insert-test-python', `M-x ee-insert-test-lua', etc... for the
list of supported languages, see:

  (find-eev \"eev-testblocks.el\" \"ee-insert-test\")

These `ee-insert-test-<lang>'s use the name of the current buffer
in the line that loads the ambient script into in the
interpreter.

The command `M-x eeit' runs `ee-insert-test', that tries to
detect the ambient language from major mode and then runs the
correct `ee-insert-test-<lang>' based on it. `M-x eeit' is
currently not very smart - see the source:

  (find-eev \"eev-testblocks.el\" \"ee-insert-test\")

Old stuff:



1. Motivation
=============
Suppose that we have to do some reasonably complex task using a
shell, and that we want to take notes of what we do because we
might have to do something similar later.

The two usual ways to interact with a shell are:

  1) through a _script_, that is, by preparing in advance all
     commands to be executed, putting them in a script file, and
     then running that file,

  2) _interactively_, by typing the commands one by one on a
     shell prompt.

Suppose that we have to discover which commands to run as we go;
that rules out preparing a script beforehand, so we need to use
the shell interactively. After issuing the right commands, the
two usual ways to retrieve what we did are:

  a) through the _shell history_, which records the last commands
     that the shell received,

  b) by looking at the full _transcript_ of our interaction with
     the shell.

The way (a) gets a list of commands, without comments, that can
be then saved into a text editor; the way (b) may require some
tricky editing to isolate the commands from their outputs.

Eepitch.el implements a simple alternative way of interacting
with shells (and other shell-like programs) while keeping notes.
It has only one essential key binding, <F8>, which is better
explained through the executable example in the next section, and
two unessential features, `M-T' and \"\", which will be
explained later.





2. The main key: <F8>
=====================
Emacs can run a shell in a buffer, and it can split its frame
into windows, like this:
   ___________________
  |         |         |
  |   our   |    a    |
  |  notes  |  shell  |
  |         |  buffer |
  |_________|_________|

The usual way to use a shell buffer is to move the cursor there
and type commands into its prompt; the eepitch-y way is to leave
the cursor at the \"notes\" buffer, write the commands for the
shell there, and send these commands to the shell with <F8>.

Here's what <F8> does:

  When we type <F8> on a line that starts with a red
  star (\"\"), it executes the rest of the line as Lisp, and
  moves down; when we type <F8> on a line that does not start
  with a \"\", it makes sure that the \"target buffer\" is being
  displayed (the \"target\" is usually the buffer called
  \"*shell*\"), it \"send\"s the current line to the target
  buffer, and moves down.

  \"Sending the current line to the target buffer\" means copying
  the contents of the current line to the target - as if the user
  had typed that line there by hand -, then \"typing\" a <RET> at
  the target buffet.

Please try that in the example after this paragraph, by typing
<F8> six times starting at the first line that says
\" (eepitch-shell)\". The three red star lines at the top will
create a target buffer, destroy it, and create it again; the
other three lines will send commands to the target shell.

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo \"We are at: $PWD\"
cd /tmp/
echo \"We changed to: $(pwd)\"




3. Other targets
================
Just like `(eepitch-shell)' creates a shell buffer and sets the
eepitch target to it, `(eepitch-python)' creates a buffer with a
Python interpreter and uses it as the eepitch target. Try:

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
def square (x):
    return x*x

print(square(5))

  We can use several targets at the time, alternating between them.
  For example:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo Hello... > /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())

 (eepitch-shell)
echo ...and bye >> /tmp/o

 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())


  There is a (much) more advanced example of working with several
  targets here:

  (find-prepared-intro \"An `ee' for Python\")





4. More on eepitch-kill
=======================
Note that `(eepitch-kill)' kills the _current_ target, that may
or may not be a shell buffer, a Python interaction buffer, etc...
That explains the first line in blocks like:

 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)

and:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)

by running the first `(eepitch-python)' we can be sure that the
following `(eepitch-kill)' will kill the Python buffer, not the
shell buffer! And the last `(eepitch-python)' in the block of
three lines will then create a new Python interaction buffer,
erasing all definitions done in previous sessions.




5. Creating eepitch blocks: `M-T'
=================================
Write just \"shell\" or \"python\" in a line, then type
`M-T' (i.e., meta-shift-t) there. The line will be turned into
three - an \" (eepitch-xxx)\", an \" (eepitch-kill)\", and an
\" (eepitch-xxx)\". We call these blocks of three lines
\"eepitch blocks\". Try this below, converting the \"shell\" into
an eepitch block for starting a shell.

shell
pwd
cd /tmp/
pwd




6. Red stars
============
Eepitch.el sets the glyph for the char 15 to a red star in the
standard display table. In layman's terms: eepitch.el tells Emacs
that the character 15 should be displayed as a red star. The
character 15 corresponds to control-O, whose default
representation on screen would be \"^O\". You can enter a
literal ^O in a buffer by typing `C-q C-o'.

1. Eepitch and eev
==================
Eepitch defines only two keys - <F8> and <M-T> - and <M-T> is a
particular case of something more general: \"wrapping commands\", that
follow these conventions:

  1) they are bound to meta-shift-letter keys (M-T, M-F, M-M, ...),
  2) they transform the current line and then move down,
  3) they produce Lisp code meant to be executed with `M-e' or `F8',
  4) they are listed at:
       (find-efunctiondescr 'eev-mode \"M-F\")
  5) their keybindings are only available when eev-mode is turned on.

To understand how they work, please follow the instructions below and
try them here. Note that this buffer is a sandbox, and it can be
recreated by executing the sexp \"(find-wrap-intro)\" at the top.

Note that the wrapping commands are all bound to key sequences of
the form meta-SHIFT-letter - don't forget the shift!!!



2. <M-T>: produce an eepitch block
==================================
If you type <M-T> on a line containing just the word \"shell\" you get
three lines, like this:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)

We call a block of three lines like this an \"eepitch block\", and
eepitch blocks can be used to set up interactions with external
programs. Try typing <M-T> on the lines that say \"shell\" and \"python\"
below, and use them to send some lines to bash and to a python
interpreter (with <F8>):

bash
export PS1='$PWD% '
cd /tmp/
function ee () { set -v; . /tmp/ee.sh; set +v; }
rm -v /tmp/ee.sh
cat > /tmp/ee.sh <<'%%%'
  echo Hello
  cd /etc/
%%%
cat   /tmp/ee.sh
bash  /tmp/ee.sh
ee

python
square = lambda x: x*x
square(5)



3. <M-F>: hyperlink to a file or a directory
============================================
If you type <M-F> on the lines below,

/etc/
/tmp/
~/
~/.emacs

you get hyperlinks like these:

# (find-fline \"/etc/\")
# (find-fline \"/tmp/\")
# (find-fline \"~/\")
# (find-fline \"~/.emacs\")



4. <M-S>: hyperlink to the output of a shell command
====================================================
If you type <M-S> on a line containing a shell command you get a
hyperlink that starts with `find-sh', and that when followed opens a
temporary buffer with the output of that shell command, like these:

  # (find-sh \"find --help\")
  # (find-sh \"find /etc | sort\")
  # (find-sh \"find /etc -type d | sort\")
  # (find-sh \"find /etc -type d -maxdepth 1 | sort\")
  # (find-sh \"find /etc -type d -maxdepth 2 | sort\")

Try it here:

dict smop
dict 'minor detail'

If you have the packages dict, dictd and dict-jargon installed
these hyperlinks will show you the meaning of the expressions
\"smop\" and \"minor detail\".

  # (find-sh \"dict smop\")
  # (find-sh \"dict 'minor detail'\")



5. <M-M>: hyperlink to a manpage
================================
Try <M-M> here:

1 tac

7. Wrapping functions generate hyperlinks
=========================================
...this is a slogan - a huge idea, in a very shortened form. In its
full form, that would be:

  (Some) wrapping function provide one of the basic ways to produce
  elisp hyperlinks quickly; the second basic way, which is a bit more
  complex conceptually, is via Elisp hyperlinks buffers. This, and the
  whole rationale behind generating and using elisp hyperlinks, is
  explained here:

    (find-links-intro \"Elisp hyperlinks buffers\")

The \"some\" in beginning of the long version of the slogan, above, is
because a few of the wrapping commands, for example, <M-T> and <M-R>,
are used to produce things that are not hyperlinks - usually other
kinds of scripts.

Note: this intro needs to be rewritten!
Ideally it should _complement_ the material in:
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.1. `eejump'\")
See the comments in:
  (find-eev \"eejump.el\")




1. The problem
==============
Suppose that we have several files that we are working on, and we
want a quick way to jump to (i.e., to visit) any of them with
very few keystrokes; moreover,

  1) we want our list of files to be preserved between one Emacs
  session and another,

  2) we know that each \"visit a file\" command will correspond
  to an elisp hyperlink.

One quick solution would be to put the list of elisp hyperlinks
in a file, and make the key `M-j' open that file. But then
jumping to a file in that list becomes a two-step process: type
`M-j', move the point to the right line, type `M-e'. This would
be similar to what happens when we use one of the `find-e*'
commands, for example `find-efunction':

  (find-efunction 'find-efunction)
     (eek \"M-h M-f find-efunction\")

Those intermediate steps - seeing the list, locating visually the
right line, moving to it - are distracting, so we want to add new
items to our wishlist:

  3) it should be possible to jump straight to any of the files
  in the list, and with very few keystrokes,

  4) the list should be stored in a format that lets us see
  quickly which are the keystrokes for accessing each item - so
  that we won't need to memorize anything,

  5) the list should be easy to modify,

  6) it should be possible to assign shorter key sequences to
  files we visit more often,

  7) the source code must be very simple.


  
2. A miniature
==============
My original solution was this: I used only one keybinding, `M-j',
that acted differently when invoked with different numeric
prefixes; when invoked as `M-1 M-j' it opened a certain file,
when invoked with `M-2 M-j' it opened another, and so on, and
when it was invoked with an unrecognized prefix or with no prefix
it jumped to its definition in my ~/.emacs. Its code was like
this (NOTE: do not execute these defuns):

  ;; eejump-simplified (`M-j'):
  ;; M-1 M-j opens a certain file,
  ;; M-2 M-j opens another file,
  ;; when the argument is 11, 22, 33 or 44 do something special,
  ;; like changing the font;
  ;; with no argument or with an unrecognized argument jump to the
  ;; definition of eejump in ~/.emacs; then we can see which numbers
  ;; correspond to which actions (the source is the documentation!), and
  ;; we can change the definition if needed - just run `M-e' at the
  ;; right place to make the changes apply.
  ;;
  \(global-set-key (kbd \"M-j\") 'eejump-simplified)
  \(defun eejump-simplified (arg) (interactive \"P\")
    (cond ((eq arg 1) (find-file \"~/NOTES\"))
          ((eq arg 2) (find-file \"~/otherfile.txt\"))
          ;;
          ((eq arg 11) (set-frame-font \"fixed\"))
          ((eq arg 22) (set-frame-font \"terminus-16\"))
          ((eq arg 33) (set-frame-font \"terminus-bold-16\"))
          ((eq arg 44) (set-frame-font \"10x20\"))
          (t (find-function 'eejump-simplified))))

except that my definition became huge with time as I added to it
more entries for files (and other actions!) that I used often,
and also entries that were used not so often...

All the \"options\" - i.e., all the `(eq arg nnn)' lines - had to
be together in a single very big defun, and there was no way to
add new options temporarily...




3. Families
===========
Let's use a shorthand for key sequences: for example, `M-123j'
instead of `M-1 M-2 M-3 M-j'.

I tend to assign related numbers to related files. For example, I
use the prefix \"5\" for things that are Emacs-related: `M-5j'
visits my .emacs, `M-555j' visits the directory with all of eev's
elisp files, and `M-51j', `M-52j', etc, visit specific eev source
files that I happen to be working on. Also, I use the prefix
\"7\" for things related to LaTeX. So, the \"5*\" family is
composed of Emacs-related files, and the \"7*\" family of
LaTex-related files.

The definition of `eejump-simplified' given above does not
satisfy these two (new!) wishlist items:

  8) it should be possible to jump to the definition of the
  \"5*\" family by typing something like `M-5678j', where
  \"5678\" is a non-assigned number that starts with the \"5*\"
  prefix,

  9) it should be possible to convert a number/hyperlink pair
  very easily into to the code that assigns that elisp hyperlink
  as the desired behavior for that number - and it should be
  possible to do that both permanently (think in changing the
  definition of `eejump-simplified' in your .emacs) and
  temporarily (i.e., for the current Emacs session only).



4. `eejump'
===========
The definition of `eejump' that comes with eev is a bit more
complex than the one given above, and it will not be shown
here (it involves a tricky recursive function) but it satisfies
the 9 wishlist items above. It works in this way: if you type,
say, `M-123j', then:

  a) if `eejump-123' is defined, then execute it;
  b) otherwise, if `eejump-12*' is defined, execute it;
  c) otherwise, if `eejump-1*' is defined, execute it;
  d) otherwise, if `eejump-*' is defined, execute it,

and if `eejump-*' also is not defined, you get an error.

Here is a block of \"defun\"s that defines (trivial) meanings for
\"91\", \"92\", \"991\", and \"992\", plus targets for the \"9*\"
family and for the \"99*\" family; it also has two tests in
comments that will be very important for an explanation below.
Let's refer as that, in this section and the next ones, as \"the
block of six defuns (plus four tests)\".

  (defun eejump-9* () (find-efunction 'eejump-9*))
  (defun eejump-91 () (message \"M-91j\"))
  (defun eejump-92 () (message \"M-92j\"))
  (defun eejump-99* () (find-efunction 'eejump-99*))
  (defun eejump-991 () (message \"M-991j\"))
  (defun eejump-992 () (message \"M-992j\"))
  ;; (find-function-noselect 'eejump-9*)
  ;; (find-function-noselect 'eejump-99*)
  ;; (find-efunction 'eejump-9*)
  ;; (find-efunction 'eejump-99*)

Try to evaluate each of the sexps above with `M-e', then try to
run things like `M-92j' and `M-992j' - they should work - and
then something like `M-99876j'; that will not work, you'll get an
error like \"Don't know where `eejump-99*' is defined\"...



5. eejump blocks
================
Let's a call a sequence of defuns for eejumps with the same
prefix, like this, starting with a `(defun eejump-<prefix>* ...)',

  (defun eejump-99* () (find-efunction 'eejump-99*))
  (defun eejump-991 () (message \"M-991j\"))
  (defun eejump-992 () (message \"M-992j\"))

an \"eejump block\".

There are two sample eejump blocks in eejump.el, for the prefixes
\"\" and \"5\", starting at:

  (find-eev \"eejump.el\" \"eejump-*\")
  (find-eev \"eejump.el\" \"eejump-5*\")

You should probably copy them to your .emacs, and then start
modifying them.




6. Making an `eejump-nn*' work
==============================
If you execute a line like 

  (defun eejump-9* () (find-efunction 'eejump-9*))

then Emacs will only record that `eejump-9*' has been defined in
this buffer - and thus will be able to jump to its definition
when you type something like `M-987j' - if two conditions are
met:

  a) the defun is executed with `M-x eval-region', `M-x
     eval-buffer', or some variant of `load' or `require' (`M-e'
     will not do!),

  b) the buffer with the definition is associated to a file; see
     these two pages of the Emacs manuals

       (find-enode \"Buffers\" \"visiting\")
       (find-elnode \"Buffer File Name\")

    if that concept is not totally familiar to you.

So, as an experiment, copy the block with six defuns and four
tests above to some buffer associated to a file, mark it, and
execute it with `M-x eval-region'. Now the tests should work -
and key sequences like `M-987j' should also work, and should jump
to the right places. See also:

  (find-elnode \"Where Defined\")



7. Producing `eejump-nnn's and `eejump-nnn*'s
=============================================
Look again to the block of six \"defun\"s above. Now type `M-J'
on each of the six lines below:

  9
  91 (message \"M-91j\")
  92 (message \"M-92j\")
  99
  991 (message \"M-991j\")
  992 (message \"M-992j\")

you will notice that you've just generated a block of defuns like
the one in the previous section! `M-J' works like this: it tries
to split the current line into \"words\" separated by whitespace,
but producing a maximum of two \"words\" (the 2nd, 3rd, etc
\"words\" as treated as a single \"word\"); if the second word is
empty, then `M-J' produces a definition for an `eejump-nnn*'; if
it is not empty, then `M-J' produces a definition for an
`eejump-nnn', treating the second \"word\" as a sexp.

Note that `M-J' is quite dumb - it doesn't check if the first
\"word\" is a number, nor if the second is a sexp. Use it with
care! Try using `M-J' on the \"a b ...\" lines below - you will
get useless definitons.

  a  b  c  d
  a  b  c
  a  b
  a




8. Permanent and temporary
==========================
If you create a block like the block of six defuns above in your
.emacs file then you'll be attributing a \"permanent\" meaning to
`M-91j', ..., `M-992j', and if you create it in a file that is
not evaluated in every Emacs session (and execute it, of course),
then you'll be attributing just a \"temporary\" meaning to
`M-91j', ..., `M-992j'.

It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.



Note: this intro needs to be rewritten!
Ideally it should _complement_ the material in:
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"8. Anchors\")



Introduction: `ee-anchor-format' and `to'
=========================================
A hyperlink like

  (to \"foo\")

jumps to the first occurrence of the string \"«foo»\" in the
current buffer. The way to convert from \"foo\" to \"«foo»\" is
controlled by the variable `ee-anchor-format', and the sexp
`(to \"foo\")' is roughly equivalent the third sexp below:

                            ee-anchor-format
                    (format ee-anchor-format \"foo\")
  (ee-goto-position (format ee-anchor-format \"foo\"))

We will call strings in `«»'s _anchors_, and we will say
that `(to \"foo\")' jumps \"to the anchor `foo'\".

Anchors can be used to create sections and indexes, as we shall
see soon - but due to some old design decisions that I was never
able to find good alternatives for, this tutorial needs to start
with a BIG WARNING.



WARNING: some glyphs need raw-text-unix
=======================================
The best way to make anchors stand out is to use colored glyphs
for them - just like we made `^O's appear as red star glyphs for
eepitch, as described here:

  (find-eepitch-intro \"\\nRed stars\\n\")

For historical reasons, the glyphs for `«' and `»' defined in

  (find-eev \"eev-anchors.el\")

use the characters 171 and 187; as far as I know, these
characters are only \"safe\" - in the sense that Emacs will not
try to convert them to anything else - in unibyte buffers. The
best way to make sure that anchors with `«»'s will work in a
certain file is to put a \"Local variables:\" section at the end
of it, as has been done in this buffer - and use that to set both
the file coding to raw-text-unix and the value of
`ee-anchor-format' to \"«%s»\".

Note that if you change a \"Local variables:\" section by hand
you will probably have to either reload the file or run `M-x
normal-mode' to make the new settings take effect.



Indexes
=======
In a situation like this,

  «one»   (to \"two\")
  «two»   (to \"one\")

we have two anchors, and typing `M-e' at the line with the anchor
\"one\" takes us to the line with the anchor \"two\", and typing
`M-e' at the line with the anchor \"two\" takes us to the line
with the anchor \"one\". In a situation like this we say that the
anchors \"one\" and \"two\" _point to one another_.

In a case like this,

  «.three»   (to \"three\")
   «three»  (to \".three\")

where the names of two anchors pointing to one another differ by
an initial dot, we will say that the anchor \".three\" is the
\"index anchor\", and the anchor \"three\" is the \"section
anchor\"; and one way to create an index for a file is to group
all the index anchors together. For an example, see:

  (find-eev \"eev-intro.el\" \".find-eev-intro\")




Creating index/section anchor pairs
===================================
Use `M-A' (`eewrap-anchor'). Note that this has been briefly
mentioned here:

  (find-wrap-intro \"All wrapping functions\")

It will convert a line with a syntax like

  comment-prefix <anchor-name>

into:

  comment-prefix «.anchor-name»	(to \"anchor-name\")
  comment-prefix «anchor-name» (to \".anchor-name\")

where comment-prefix is any string and anchor-name is a string
without `<>'s. Note that the `<>'s, which are easy to type, are
converted into `«»'s, which are harder.

Note: this intro needs to be rewritten!
Ideally it should _complement_ the material in:
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9. Shorter hyperlinks\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\")



1. Avoiding full path names
===========================
Suppose that you have downloaded (\"psne\"-ed) this URL,

  http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.4.tar.gz

with `M-x brep' - see:

  (find-psne-intro)

and you unpacked that tarball into the directory ~/usrc/ (I
prefer to use that instead of /usr/src/) with:

  tar -C ~/usrc/ -xvzf $S/http/www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.4.tar.gz

Now you can access some directories and files of the unpacked
tarball with:

  (find-fline \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/\")
  (find-fline \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/src/\")
  (find-fline \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/src/lstrlib.c\")
  (find-fline \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/test/\")
  (find-fline \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/test/README\")
  (find-fline \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/doc/\")
  (find-w3m   \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/doc/contents.html\")

but it's a bit clumsy to have to use the \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/\"
every time, so eev provides a nice way to define shorthands. We
want to be able to write just this instead of the sexps above,

  (find-lua51file \"\")
  (find-lua51file \"src/\")
  (find-lua51file \"src/lstrlib.c\")
  (find-lua51file \"test/\")
  (find-lua51file \"test/README\")
  (find-lua51file \"doc/\")
  (find-lua51w3m  \"doc/contents.html\")

and here the directory \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/\" became a mnemonic
\"lua51\" in the middle of the names of some functions.

We will call these sexps with \"lua51\" \"shorter hyperlinks\".



2. Shorter hyperlinks
=====================
How can we generate the definitions for `find-lua51file' and
`find-lua51w3m' from just the strings \"lua51\" and
\"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/\"? Try this:

  (find-code-c-d \"lua51\" \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/\")

you will get a temporary buffer with a lot of Lisp code -
including a definition for `find-lua51file' and another one for
`find-lua51w3m'. That Lisp code has not been executed yet; the
function `find-code-c-d' is just for debugging, and we can regard
it as a hyperlink to the code that this sexp would execute:

  (code-c-d \"lua51\" \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/\")
  
So, to define a family of functions including `find-lua51file'
and `find-lua51w3m', for a given \"mnemonic\" - \"lua51\" in this
case - and a given \"directory\" - \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/\" - we run
this:

  (code-c-d \"lua51\" \"~/usrc/lua-5.1.4/\")

which generates a block of Lisp code, as a string, and evaluates
it. Note: the original (and rather confusing) terminology for the
\"mnemonic\" was \"code\"; that's why the \"c\" in `code-c-d'.



3. Extra arguments to `code-c-d'
================================
`code-c-d' supports extra arguments - for example, this works:

  (find-code-c-d \"el\" \"~/usrc/emacs/lisp/\" :info \"elisp\")

Look at the end of the generated code and you will see that it
has a definition for `find-elnode' - such that

  (find-elnode \"Constant Variables\")

is a shorthand (a \"shorter hyperlink\") for:

  (find-node \"(elisp)Constant Variables\")

What is important to understand here is how these definitions
with extra arguments are structured - so that you will be able to
understand the source code when you need to. Both `code-c-d' and
`find-code-c-d' are defined with a `&rest' in their argument
lists, like this (NOTE: do not execute these defuns!):

  (defun      code-c-d (c d &rest rest) ...)
  (defun find-code-c-d (c d &rest rest) ...)

and they both invoke `ee-code-c-d', which does all the template
work and returns a big string; `ee-code-c-d' passes its `rest'
argument to a recursive function called `ee-code-c-d-rest', and
for each one of the suported keywords there is a corresponding
function, also recursive; for `:info' it is called
`ee-code-c-d-:info'. Their specifications are like this:

  (defun   ee-code-c-d (c d &rest rest) ...)
  (defun   ee-code-c-d-rest      (rest) ...)
  (defun   ee-code-c-d-:info (manual &rest rest) ...)

and one very non-obvious trick is used to make the code short.
When `ee-code-c-d-rest' and `ee-code-c-d-:info' are run they can
access the values the `c' and the `d' that were passed to
`ee-code-c-d' (due to dynamic scoping), so `c' and `d' do not
need to be passed down explicitly as arguments.

Try:

  (find-code-c-d      \"CODE\" \"/DIR/\" :info \"INFO\")

It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.



Note: you will need a basic understanding of eepitch and
code-c-d to understand parts of this intro. See:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"6.1. The main key: <F8>\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9. Shorter hyperlinks\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.3. Hyperlinks to PDF files\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.5. Shorter hyperlinks to PDF files\")





1. PDF-like documents
=====================
Let's introduce a bit of (improvised!) terminology: we will say
that a document is \"PDF-like\" when it is in a format like PDF,
PostScript, DVI or DJVU - i.e., divided into pages. Emacs has a
standard mode for viewing PDF-like documents,

  (find-enode \"Document View\")

but we will see a more eev-like way of pointing to pages of
PDF-like documents.




2. Preparation
==============
We need to start by downloading a PDF file to use in our
examples. If you run this e-script

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
  cd
  wget -nc https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf

you will download a local copy of J.M. Coetzee's \"The Lives of
Animals\" into your home directory. To check that the PDF has been
downloaded, use:

  (find-fline \"~/\")
  (find-fline \"~/\"  \"Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (find-sh0 \"ls -l ~/Coetzee99.pdf\")

Eev also implements another way, called \"psne\", to download
local copies of files from the internet.\"Psne-ing\" a URL like

  https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf

downloads it to a local file with a name like:

       $S/https/tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf
  ~/snarf/https/tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf

that is _much_ longer that just \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\"; this has the
advantage of preserving more information about the URL from which
the file came, but sometimes these longer names feels clumsy.
Psne-ing is discussed a more advanced tutorial:

  (find-psne-intro)

In this tutorial we will use the home directory and the shorter
file name.




3. Hyperlinks to PDF files
==========================
If you have xpdf installed then this sexp

  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")

should work as a \"hyperlink to the PDF\": it calls xpdf as an
external program - like we did with browsers in the main tutorial -

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3.1. Non-elisp hyperlinks\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3.1. Non-elisp hyperlinks\" \"find-firefox\")

to display the PDF file that we downloaded.

The main keys of xpdf are:

  q         quit xpdf
  PageDown  scroll down/go to next page
  PageUp    scroll up/go to previous page
  arrows    scroll within the current page
  +         zoom in one step
  -         zoom out out step
  0         set zoom to 125%
  alt-f     toggle full-screen; use twice to fit document to page

Note that `q' \"goes back to Emacs\".

If you have the program pdftotext installed - hint: \"apt-get install
poppler-utils\"! - then you can also display PDFs in another way. This
sexp

  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")

work as a \"hyperlink to the _text_ of the PDF\": it extracts the text
from the PDF using the program \"pdftotext\" and displays that in an
Emacs buffer.




4. Hyperlinks to pages of PDF files
===================================
It is possible to create hyperlinks that point to a specific page in a
PDF file. Compare what happens when you run these sexps:

  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 1)
  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 1 \"The Lives of Animals\")
  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3)
  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3 \"LECTURE I\")
  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3 \"LECTURE I\" \"[113]\")

The top three sexps open the PDF at page 1 - the default. The bottom
three sexps open it at page 3. The arguments after the number are
ignored by Emacs - they are there to make these links more expressive
for humans.

The hyperlinks to the text of a PDF interpret the numeric number as a
page number and the following arguments as strings to search for. Try:

  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 1)
  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 1 \"The Lives of Animals\")
  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3)
  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3 \"LECTURE I\")
  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3 \"LECTURE I\" \"[113]\")

For more information about these string arguments, see:

  (find-refining-intro \"1. Pos-spec-lists\")

A pair of sexps like this, in which both point to the same
position of a PDF,

  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3 \"LECTURE I\" \"[113]\")
  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3 \"LECTURE I\" \"[113]\")

will be called a `find-pdf'-pair.




5. A convention on page numbers
===============================
The `(+ -110 113)'s in

  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")

are a bit mysterious at first sight. 

We are accessing a PDF that is an excerpt of a book. The third
page of the PDF has a \"[113]\" at its footer to indicate that it
is the page 113 of the book. Let's use the terms _page number_
and _page label_ to distinguish the two numberings: in this case,
the page whose page number is 3 is the page whose page label is
113. These two sexps

  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 113))
  (find-livesofanimalspage 3)

are equivalent, but the first one is more human-friendly: the 113
is a page label, and the -110 is adjustment (we call it the
\"offset\") to convert the 113 that humans prefer to see into
the 3 that xpdf needs to receive.





6. How the external programs are called
=======================================
Both `find-pdf-page' and `find-pdf-text' invoke external programs -
but how, exactly? Let's take a look at a hack that shows this. If
you prepend an \"ee-\" to `find-pdf-page' and `find-pdf-text' sexps,
like in:

  (ee-find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (ee-find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3)
  (ee-find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (ee-find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3)

you will get sexps that stop just before invoking the external
programs - they just show how these externals programs _would be_
invoked, i.e., they show the options that would be passed to them. The
results of the sexps above will be lists like these:

  (\"xpdf\" \"-fullscreen\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (\"xpdf\" \"-fullscreen\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" \"3\")
  (\"pdftotext\" \"-layout\" \"-enc\" \"Latin1\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" \"-\")
  (\"pdftotext\" \"-layout\" \"-enc\" \"Latin1\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" \"-\")

Note that `ee-find-pdf-text' does not pass the argument \"3\" to
\"pdftotext\". A sexp like

  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" 3)

first produces the conversion to text of the full PDF, and then
finds the page 3 in it by counting formfeeds, as described here:

  (find-enode \"Pages\" \"formfeed\")





7. Shorter hyperlinks to PDF files
==================================
If you run these sexps

  (code-pdf-page \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (code-pdf-text \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" -110)

they will define the functions `find-livesofanimalspage' and
`find-livesofanimalstext', and then these hyperlinks should work:

  (find-livesofanimalspage)
  (find-livesofanimalstext)
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 113))
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 113))
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 127) \"wrong thoughts\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 127) \"wrong thoughts\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 132) \"into the place of their victims\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 132) \"into the place of their victims\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 133) \"To write that book I had to think\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 133) \"To write that book I had to think\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 134) \"woke up haggard in the mornings\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 134) \"woke up haggard in the mornings\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 143) \"Babies have no self-consciousness\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 143) \"Babies have no self-consciousness\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 145) \"squirrel doing its thinking\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 145) \"squirrel doing its thinking\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 147) \"Rilke's panther\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 147) \"Rilke's panther\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 162) \"a grasp of the meaning\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 162) \"a grasp of the meaning\")
  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 164) \"last common ground\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 164) \"last common ground\")

Hyperlinks like

  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")

behave roughly as abbreviations for:

  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")




8. `find-pdf'-pairs
===================
Let's introduce some terminology. Remember that we call a pair of
sexps like

  (find-pdf-page \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-pdf-text \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")

a \"`find-pdf'-pair\"; a pair like

  (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 113) \"LECTURE I.\")

will be called a \"short `find-pdf'-pair\", as in:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9. Shorter hyperlinks\")

and a pair like

  (code-pdf-page \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (code-pdf-text \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" -110)

will be called a `code-pdf'-pair.

The \"livesofanimals\" will the called the _stem_. The \"-110\"
will be called the _offset_.




9. Generating three pairs
=========================
Eev has a high-level function that generates at once, for a
single PDF file, a `find-pdf'-pair, a `code-pdf'-pair, and a
short `find-pdf'-pair. To see what it produces, try:

  (find-code-pdf-links \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (find-code-pdf-links \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" \"livesofanimals\")

`find-code-pdf-links' is somewhat similar to `find-latex-links',
in this aspect:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.5. `find-latex-links'\" \"change the \\\"{stem}\\\"\")

If you run just

  (find-code-pdf-links \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")

it will generate a buffer that has \"{c}\"s in several places and
that follows the convention that \"the first line regenerates the
buffer\". If you substitute the \"{c}\" in the top sexp by
\"livesofanimals\" and type `M-e' the buffer will be recreated
with each \"{c}\" replaced by \"livesofanimals\".

The user-friendly way to run `find-code-pdf-links' is by typing
`M-h M-p' in Dired mode. If you want to generate the three pairs
for a file \"~/foo/bar/story.pdf\" then visit the directory
\"~/foo/bar/\", put the cursor on the line that lists the file
\"story.pdf\", and type `M-h M-p'. Try it with our test file:

  (find-fline \"~/\" \"Coetzee99.pdf\")



10. Generating a pair with the page number
==========================================
If you type `M-h M-p' and you're not in Dired mode then `M-h M-p'
will try to generate a short `find-pdf'-pair pointing to the
current position in the current page of the current PDF
file (converted to text). The function bound to `M-h M-p' tries
to guess four things: the stem, the offset, the page number, and
the string to the be used as a pos-spec. Let's see first a
situation where everything works. Run the four sexps below and
type `M-h M-p':

  (code-pdf-page \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\")
  (code-pdf-text \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" -110)
  (kill-new \"wrong thoughts\")
  (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 127) \"wrong thoughts\")

You will get an elisp hyperlinks buffer whose middle links are
four short `find-pdf'-pairs, all pointing to the current page:

  # (find-livesofanimalspage 17)
  # (find-livesofanimalstext 17)
  # (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 127))
  # (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 127))

  # (find-livesofanimalspage 17 \"wrong thoughts\")
  # (find-livesofanimalstext 17 \"wrong thoughts\")
  # (find-livesofanimalspage (+ -110 127) \"wrong thoughts\")
  # (find-livesofanimalstext (+ -110 127) \"wrong thoughts\")

The second and the fourth pairs use \"(+ -110 127)\" instead of
\"17\" as the page number; the third and the fourth pairs point
to the string \"wrong thoughts\" in the page.




11. How `M-h M-p' guesses everything
====================================
The method that `M-h M-p' uses to guess the stem, the offset, the
page and the pos-spec is so error-prone and gives unexpected
results so often that it's worth to describe it in detail.

  1. The stem is taken from the global variable `ee-page-c'.

  2. Every call to a function like `find-xxxtext' sets
     `ee-page-c' to \"xxx\" - for example, a call to
     `find-livesofanimalstext' sets `ee-page-c' to
     \"find-livesofanimalstext\". So `ee-page-c' usually holds
     the stem of the last function of the form `find-xxxtext'
     that was run.

  3. The offset is taken from the global variable
     `ee-page-offset'.

  4. A call to, say, `find-livesofanimalstext', sets
     `ee-page-offset' to the offset that was declared here:

       (code-pdf-text \"livesofanimals\" \"~/Coetzee99.pdf\" -110)

     So `ee-page-offset' usually holds the offset of the last
     function of the form `find-xxxtext' that was run.

  5. The page number is obtained by counting the number of
     formfeeds between the beginning of the buffer and the
     current position. If there are 16 formfeeds then the current
     page is 17.

  6. The pos-spec - \"wrong thoughts\" in the example - is the
     string in the top of the kill ring. See:

       (find-refining-intro \"2. Refining hyperlinks\" \"kill-new\")

If you want to see an example where `M-h M-p' guesses everything
wrong you can type `M-h M-p' here... as we're not in Dired mode
`M-h M-p' will think that we're in the conversion to text of
\"livesofanimals\", in page 1, and it will generate hyperlinks to
that page of the book!



12. Another way to generate `code-pdf'-pairs

This intro expands an idea that was mentioned briefly at:
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3.1. Non-elisp hyperlinks\")
and combines it with the idea of \"local copies\" from:
  (find-psne-intro \"the second way\")
  (find-psne-intro \"1. Local copies of files from the internet\")
  (find-psne-intro \"5. `browse-url' and friends\")




1. Introduction
===============
We saw in

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3.1. Non-elisp hyperlinks\")

that eev defines some functions with names starting with `br'
that are similar to `browse-url', and we saw in

  (find-psne-intro \"the second way\")
  (find-psne-intro \"1. Local copies of files from the internet\")
  (find-psne-intro \"3. The new way: M-x brep\")

how to create local copies of files; after downloading a local
copy of, say,

  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html

into

  $S/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html

you can open the local copy by running `M-x browse-url', `M-x brg'
or `M-x brff' on the \"file:///\" URL below,

  file:///home/edrx/snarf/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html

but note that the \"file:///\" URL has an \"edrx\" - my username
- in the middle of the file name, so this only works without
changes if you use \"edrx\" as your username...




2. The `l' variants
===================
After creating `brg' and `brff' I created variants of them that
would open the local copy of the URL at point instead of the
original URL - or, more precisely, that would open the result of
applying `ee-url-to-local-url' to the original URL. Try:

  (ee-url-to-local-url
   \"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html\")

These variants were called `brgl' and `brffl' - I used the
convention that the suffix `l' meant \"use the local copy\".



3. The `d' variants
===================
After creating `brgl' and `brffl' I realized that it would be
easy to create variants of them that would work in dired mode.
If we visit a directory - for example, this one,

  (find-fline \"$S/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\")

and we put the point in a line with an HTML on it - for example,
on the line with the \"emacs-paper.html\" - then typing `M-x
brgd' there converts the full pathname of the file at point to a
\"file:///\" URL, like this,

                          $S/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html
  -> file:///home/edrx/snarf/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html

and opens the resulting \"file:///\" url with `brg'.

The suffix `d' means \"use the file in this line in dired\".




4. `brxxx'-functions
====================
`browse-url' has several variants, with names like
`browse-url-firefox' and `browse-url-chromium', that open the URL
at point using specific programs. See:

  (find-epackage 'browse-url)
  (find-enode \"Browse-URL\")

We say that `brg', `brgl' and `brgd' are \"`brxxx'-functions\"
with \"base function\" `find-googlechrome'; `brgl' is the `l' (or
\"local\") variant, and `brgd' is the `d' (or \"dired\") variant;
`brg' is sometimes called the \"remote\" variant.




5. `code-brurl'
===============
Remember that `code-c-d' generates lisp code and executes it, and
that `find-code-c-d' generates the same lisp code as `code-c-d'
but displays it instead of executing it; this was explained, with
examples, here:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\" \"find-code-c-d\")

Eev has a function called `code-brurl' that works like `code-c-d'
and that creates several `brxxx'-functions with the same base
function. To understand what the `code-brurl' sexp below does,

  ;; From:
  ;; (find-eev \"eev-brxxx.el\" \"code-brxxxs\")
  ;; (find-eev \"eev-brxxx.el\" \"code-brxxxs\" \"brg\")

  (code-brurl 'find-googlechrome  :remote 'brg  :local 'brgl  :dired 'brgd)

We run:

  (find-code-brurl 'find-googlechrome  :remote 'brg  :local 'brgl  :dired 'brgd)

Note that the base function in this example is
`find-googlechrome', that is a function that expects a URL.




6. `code-brfile'
================
We saw how to create `brxxx'-functions using `find-googlechrome'
as the base function; remember that `find-googlechrome' is a
function that expects a URL.

If we download a local copy of a PDF, like we did here,

  (find-pdf-like-intro \"2. Preparation\")

      https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf
  -> $S/https/tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf

then it makes sense to have a `brxxx'-function, called `brpdfl',
that we can run on the \"https://\" URL above, and that will open
the \"$S/https/\" file corresponding to the URL using
`find-pdf-page'... but `find-pdf-page' is a function that expects
a filename, not a URL, so `code-brurl' wouldn't work...

What we want can be done by the sexp below:

  ;; From:
  ;; (find-eev \"eev-pdflike.el\" \"code-brxxxs\")
  ;; (find-eev \"eev-pdflike.el\" \"code-brxxxs\" \"brpdfl\")
  (code-brfile 'find-pdf-page  :local 'brpdfl  :dired 'brpdfd)

To understand what it does, run:

  (find-code-brfile 'find-pdf-page  :local 'brpdfl  :dired 'brpdfd)

and read the docstrings.

Note that in the previous section we had a \":remote 'brg\", that
defined a remote variant. It doesn't make sense to apply
`find-pdf-page' to a remote URL, so we don't have a \":remote\"
here.




Old stuff:
(TODO: revise it!)




7. Old introduction
===================
We saw in

  (find-psne-intro)
  (find-psne-intro \"M-x brep\")
  (find-psne-intro \"M-x brfl\")
  (find-psne-intro \"5. `browse-url' and friends\")

that we can use `M-x brep' to download local copies of files from
the internet, and that `M-x brfl' on a URL runs `find-fline' on
the local copy of that URL. `brep' and `brfl' are
\"`browse-url'-like functions\" defined by eev; we will refer to
them, and to other such functions, as \"brxxx-functions\". Every
brxxx-function is an interactive interface to some \"base
function\"; for `brep' and `brfl' we have:

    brxxx-function   base function
    --------------   -------------
         brep        find-psne-links
         brfl        find-fline

What we will see here is how `code-brfile' and `code-brurl' -
which are somewhat similar to `code-c-d' - can be used to define
brxxx-functions from base functions.




8. A first example
==================
Let's define two trivial base functions, one that expects a URL,
and another one that expects a file name:

  (defun foo-url  (url)      (format \"Got URL: %s\"      url))
  (defun foo-file (filename) (format \"Got filename: %s\" filename))

Note that they don't do much - they just return explanatory
strings.

These two calls,

  (code-brurl  'foo-url  :remote 'brshowu :local 'brshowul)
  (code-brfile 'foo-file                  :local 'brshowfl)

define three brxxx-functions: `brshowu' and `brshowul' for the
base function `foo-url', and `brshowfl' for the base function
`foo-file'. You can inspect the definitions by running these
sexps,

  (find-code-brurl  'foo-url  :remote 'brshowu :local 'brshowul)
  (find-code-brfile 'foo-file                  :local 'brshowfl)

and you can test what `foo-url', `foo-file', `brshowu',
`brshowul', and `brshowfl' do by running the sexps below.

  (foo-url \"http://a/b\")
    => \"Got URL: http://a/b\"

  (foo-file \"/c/d/e/f\")
    => \"Got filename: /c/d/e/f\"

  (brshowu  \"http://a/b\")
    => `(foo-url \"http://a/b\") -> \"Got URL: http://a/b\"'

  (brshowul \"http://a/b\")
    => `(foo-url \"file:///home/edrx/snarf/http/a/b\") ->
        \"Got URL: file:///home/edrx/snarf/http/a/b\"'

  (brshowfl \"http://a/b\")
    => `(foo-file \"/home/edrx/snarf/http/a/b\") ->
        \"Got filename: /home/edrx/snarf/http/a/b\"'

Now let's go to what matters. Put the point on the URL below, and
run `M-x brshowu', `M-x brshowul' and `M-x brshowfl':

  http://a/b

you will see that `brshowu', `brshowul', and `brshowfl' can be
called interactively, and when they are called interactively they
use as their argument either the URL around point, or something
obtained from it - the local file name or a local URL associated
to that URL.




9. The conversions
==================
One underlying idea behind all this is that we have two
conversion functions, one from URLs to file names, and another
from (absolute) file names to URLs starting with \"file:///\".
They work like this:

  http://a/b  ->  $S/http/a/b  ->  file:///home/edrx/snarf/http/a/b
                       /tmp/c  ->  file:///tmp/c

try:

  (ee-url-to-fname \"http://a/b\")
  (ee-fname-to-url \"/tmp/c\")
  (ee-url-to-local-url \"http://a/b\")

Now execute the sexps below (with `M-2 M-e') to examine the code
that calls to `code-brurl' and `code-brfile' generate and
execute:

  (find-code-brurl  'foo-url  :remote 'brshowu :local 'brshowul)
  (find-code-brfile 'foo-file                  :local 'brshowfl)






10. Naming conventions for brxxx-functions
==========================================
By convention, each name for a brxxx-function is composed of a
prefix, a stem, and a suffix. The prefix is always \"br\", the
stem is a mnemonic for the base function, and the suffix is
either \"\", \"l\", or \"d\", meaning:

  \"\"   - use the URL without changes
  \"l\"  - use the local copy
  \"d\"  - dired variation (see below)

Here are the stems for some of the brxxx-functions defined by
eev:

  Base function       receives   stem
  -------------       --------   ----
  find-psne-links     URL        \"ep\"
  browse-url-firefox  URL        \"m\"
  find-googlechrome   URL        \"g\"
  find-w3m   	      URL        \"w\"
  find-fline          file name  \"f\"
  find-audio          file name  \"audio\"
  find-video          file name  \"video\"
  find-xpdf-page      file name  \"xpdf\"
  find-evince-page    file name  \"evince\"
  find-xdvi-page      file name  \"xdvi\"
  find-djvu-page      file name  \"djvu\"
  find-pdf-text       file name  \"pdftext\"
  find-djvu-text      file name  \"djvutext\"

In our example with `foo-url' and `foo-file' we had:

  Base function       receives   stem
  -------------       --------   ----
  foo-url             URL        showu
  foo-file            file name  showf




11. Calling `code-brurl' and `code-brfile'
==========================================

  (code-brurl '<U-function>
                   :remote 'br<stem>   :local 'br<stem>l   :dired 'br<stem>d)
                   \\---------------/   \\---------------/   \\----------------/
                       optional              optional             optional

  (code-brfile '<F-function>           :local 'br<stem>l   :dired 'br<stem>d)
                                       \\---------------/   \\----------------/
                                             optional             optional

This, like many other parts of eev, is a hack with a very concise
calling syntax - so we will see an example first, and then
dissect it to understand precisely how it works. If you are
curious about the inspirations behind it, here they are:

  (find-code-c-d-intro)
  (find-code-c-d-intro \"find-code-c-d\")
  (find-code-c-d-intro \"Extra arguments\")
  (find-enode \"Browse-URL\")



12. The dired variation

Note: this intro is being rewritten!
We mentioned briefly in

  (find-pdf-like-intro \"2. Preparation\")

that there are two \"natural\" ways to store a local copy of a
file from the internet... here we will discuss the second way, in
which the conversion from URL to a local file name works like
this:

      https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf
  -> $S/https/tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf





1. Local copies of files from the internet
==========================================
Emacs knows how to fetch files from the internet, but for most
purposes it is better to use local copies. Suppose that the
environment variable $S is set to ~/snarf/; then running this

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
  mkdir -p $S/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
  cd       $S/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
  wget      http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html
  echo     'http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html' >> ~/.psne.log

  # (find-fline \"$S/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html\")
  # (find-w3m   \"$S/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html\")

creates a local copy of `emacs-paper.html' inside ~/snarf/http/
and appends the URL to the file ~/.psne.log. The two lines in
comments are hyperlinks to the local copy; The `find-fline' opens
it as a file in the obvious way, and `find-w3m' opens it \"as
HTML\", using a text-mode web browser called w3m that can be run
either in standalone mode or inside Emacs; `find-w3m' uses w3m's
Emacs interface, and it accepts extra arguments, which are
treated as a pos-spec-list.



2. The old way: psne
====================
A long time ago eev used to include a shell function called
`psne' that ran all that with a single command. This:

  psne http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html

would run the `mkdir', the `cd', the `wget' and the `echo' above.

If psne were just a shell script then it wouldn't be able to
change the current directory for the calling shell, so it had to
be defined as shell function instead of a script, and the user
had to patch his ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc, or whatever) to install
the definition for psne and make it available. That was VERY
clumsy.

From now on we will use \"psne\" as a verb: to psne a URL means
to download a local copy of it into the right place, change to
its directory and save its name into the file \"~/.psne.log\".




3. The new way: M-x brep
========================
Try to run this:

  (find-psne-links \"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html\")

or, equivalently, put the point on the URL below and then run
`M-x brep':

  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html

You will get a temporary buffer for psne-ing the URL above. It
will contain a `mkdir', a `cd', a `wget' and an `echo', plus an
eepitch block and some elisp hyperlinks, and it can be executed
with `F8's. Moral of the story: the \"new\" way to download a
local copy of a url is to put the point on it, then run `M-x
brep', then execute the resulting e-script. This does not require
any patching of rcfiles, as the shell-function version of `psne'
used to do.



4. The environment variable $S
==============================
If when eev is loaded by Emacs the environment variable $S is
unset, it will be set to a default value - namely, to the
expansion of \"$HOME/snarf\". Processes started from Emacs, such
as shells created with `eepitch-shell' or `find-sh', or external
terminals created by sexps like

  (find-bgprocess \"xterm\")
  (find-bgprocess \"gnome-terminal\")
  (find-bgprocess \"eterm\")

will then inherit that value. Try it:

  (getenv \"S\")
  (find-sh0 \"echo $S\")

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
echo $S

Try also to create an external shell not from Emacs - for
example, from your window manager's list of available
applications, or from a text-mode login - and run \"echo $S\"
there: you will notice that $S is unset.

Old versions of eev used to require the user to run a script that
would patch his rcfiles (i.e., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc) to set
$S on startup. That turned out to be unreliable - it was better
to teach people how to distinguish those processes that inherit
$S from Emacs from those that don't, and let the experts patch
their rcfiles by hand.



5. `browse-url' and friends
===========================
If you place the point on the URL below

  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html

and run `M-x browse-url', Emacs will make an external browser
visit the remote version of that URL. One (bad) way to visit the
local copy of that URL is to modify the URL above by hand to
adjust it to your value of $S, until you obtain something like
this:

  file:///home/edrx/snarf/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html

and then run `M-x browse-url' on it.

One - rather primitive - way of visiting the local copy of that
URL with find-file is to modify the URL by hand, replacing its
\"http://\" with n \"$S/http/\", and then visit that file. For
example:

                http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html
  (find-fline \"$S/http/www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html\")

If you put the point on the URL and run `M-x brfl' on it you will
visit the local copy \"as a file\", with `find-file' /
`find-fline'. Visiting URLs - or their local copies - is
something that we do so frequently that we need ways to do that
with few keystrokes, which is why `brfl' has a short - and
cryptic - name. The conventions are:

  \"br\" is the common prefix for all the browse-url-like
       functions in eev,
  \"f\"  means to use `find-fline' (or, equivalently, `find-file'),
  \"l\"  is an optional suffix meaning to use the local copy.

The details on how to create these \"brxxx functions\" are here:

This buffer is _temporary_ and _editable_.
It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.



Prerequisite:
  (find-pdf-like-intro)
This intro is being rewritten.




1. Time offsets
===============
Links to audio and video files are similar to links to pdf-like
documents, but instead of page numbers we use \"time offsets\" to
refer to positions. Time offsets are strings like 1:23, 12:34, or
1:23:45. The sexp hyperlinks below should all work if you have the
files that they refer to, and if you have mpv and xterm installed:

  (find-audio \"/tmp/mysong.mp3\")
  (find-audio \"/tmp/mysong.mp3\" \"1:23\")
  (find-audio \"/tmp/mysong.mp3\" \"1:23\" \"comments are ignored\")
  (find-video \"/tmp/myvideo.mp4\")
  (find-video \"/tmp/myvideo.mp4\" \"1:23\")
  (find-video \"/tmp/myvideo.mp4\" \"1:23\" \"comments are ignored\")

Note that they work by invoking an external player - mpv, by
default - and its error messages appear here:

  (find-ebuffer \"*Messages*\")




2. `eev-avadj-mode'
===================
\"avadj-mode\" is a shorthand for \"audio/video adjust mode\".
When `eev-avadj-mode' is active we get keys for adjusting time
offsets quickly and for playing again the default audio or video
file at a given time offset, all of this without moving the
point. The keys are:

  M--    decrease the time offset by one second
  M-+    increase the time offset by one second
  M-=    same as M-+, for convenience
  M-p    play the default audio/video file at a time offset

You can toggle eev-avadj-mode on and off with `M-x
eev-avadj-mode', or with these sexps:

  (eev-avadj-mode 0)
  (eev-avadj-mode)

When it is on you will see an \"avadj\" at the mode line. Let's
examine `M--' and `M-+' first. With eev-avadj-mode on, try typing
several `M--'s and `M-+'s (or `M-='s) on the line below:

  This time offset - 9:59 - will change

Now, as an exercise, try to use `M--'s and `M-+'s/`M-='s, plus
`M-h M-2' (`ee-duplicate-this-line') and other more standard
editing commands, to convert this line

  (find-exampleaudio \"0:00\")

into:

  (find-exampleaudio \"0:00\")
  (find-exampleaudio \"0:12\" \"blah\")
  (find-exampleaudio \"0:30\" \"bleh\")

That should give you an idea of how to index audio or video files
- by creating elisp hyperlinks, with comments, to specific
positions in them. Of course in a real-world situation we would
execute these sexps occasionally to check if they are really
pointing to the right places, and then make further adjustments;
we are not doing that yet.

The idea of a \"default audio/video file\" will be explained
later.




3. The time-from-bol
====================
All the keys in eev-avadj-mode operate on the \"time-from-bol\"
of the current line: the first occurrence, in the current line,
of a string that looks like a time offset. Note that the search
starts from the beginning of the line (\"-from-bol\"), and if
there are several possibilities, the first one is chosen.

Remember that `M-e' has a variant that just highlights what would
be executed, instead of evaluating a sexp:

  (find-eval-intro \"`M-0 M-e'\")

`M-p' also has something like this: `M-0 M-p' highlights the
time-from-bol and displays in the echo area the sexp that it
would execute to invoke a player - instead of running that sexp.
Try to evaluate these sexps:

  (code-audio \"sunwillset\" \"~/Zoe_Keating/Sun_Will_Set.ogg\")
  (find-sunwillset)
  ;; ^ don't worry if this fails - we are only calling it
  ;;   to set `ee-audiovideo-last'

and now try `M-0 M-p' on these lines:

  ;; 4:19 blah
  ;; 2:19

For more realistic examples, see:

  (find-videos-intro)




4. Short hyperlinks to audio and video files
============================================
This sexp

  (code-video \"eevtk2video\" \"~/eev-videos/three-keys-2.mp4\")

defines a function `find-eevtk2video'. Note that the function
definition in

  (find-code-video \"eevtk2video\" \"~/eev-videos/three-keys-2.mp4\")

has this line:

  (setq ee-audiovideo-last 'find-eevtk2video)

Every call to a function with a name like `find-*audio' or
`find-*video' sets the variable `ee-audiovideo-last'.




4.1. `find-code-audiovideo-links'
---------------------------------
The easist way to produce `code-audio' or `code-video' hyperlinks
uses `M-h M-a', that calls `find-code-audiovideo-links' and is
very similar to:

  (find-pdf-like-intro \"9. Generating three pairs\")
  (find-pdf-like-intro \"9. Generating three pairs\" \"M-h M-p\")

A test:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
  mkdir ~/eev-videos/
  cd    ~/eev-videos/
  wget -nc http://angg.twu.net/eev-videos/three-keys-2.mp4

  # (find-code-audiovideo-links \"~/eev-videos/three-keys-2.mp4\" \"eevtk2\")
  # (find-fline \"~/eev-videos/\")
  # (find-fline \"~/eev-videos/\" \"three-keys-2.mp4\")
  #   ^ Type `M-h M-a' on the line with the .mp4

\[Todo: explain M-p in eev-avadj-mode]



4.2. `eewrap-audiovideo'
------------------------
If you type `M-V' (`eewrap-audiovideo') on a line containing a
shorthand word and a file name of an audio or video file, for
example, here,

  sunwillset  ~/Zoe_Keating/Sun_Will_Set.ogg

you will get something like this:

  ;; (find-fline \"~/Zoe_Keating/\")
  (code-audio \"sunwillset\" \"~/Zoe_Keating/Sun_Will_Set.ogg\")
  (code-video \"sunwillset\" \"~/Zoe_Keating/Sun_Will_Set.ogg\")
  ;; (find-sunwillset)
  ;; (find-sunwillset \"0:00\")

you should delete the line with the wrong sexp by hand - in this
case the wrong one is the one with `code-video', as we are
working with a sound file - and execute the other one; this will
define a function called `find-sunwillset', that plays the audio
file with `find-audio'. Run this this sexp to inspect its code:

  (find-code-audio \"sunwillset\" \"/tmp/Zoe_Keating__Sun_Will_Set.ogg\")

you will notice that running `find-sunwillset' sets a variable,
with:

  (setq ee-audiovideo-last 'find-sunwillset)

As we shall see soon, some operations play again the default
audio or video file, starting from some given time offset. The
default is always what is stored in `ee-audiovideo-last', and
each call to a short hyperlink of the form `find-xxxaudio' or
`find-xxxvideo' sets that variable.



4.3. A demo
-----------
Here's some code to test `find-video' and `code-video'. Make sure
that you have mpv installed, and run this escript block:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
  # http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6LmZ0A1s9U
  # http://angg.twu.net/eev-videos/Punch_and_Judy_Mark_Poulton-K6LmZ0A1s9U.mp4
  mkdir ~/eev-videos/
  cd    ~/eev-videos/
  wget -nc http://angg.twu.net/eev-videos/Punch_and_Judy_Mark_Poulton-K6LmZ0A1s9U.mp4

It will download a copy of a video from youtube; I prepared the
.mp4 by running \"youtube-dl -f 18\" on the youtube URL and
renaming the result.

Then try:

  (find-video \"~/eev-videos/Punch_and_Judy_Mark_Poulton-K6LmZ0A1s9U.mp4\")
  (code-video \"punchandjudyvideo\" \"~/eev-videos/Punch_and_Judy_Mark_Poulton-K6LmZ0A1s9U.mp4\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo)
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"0:00\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"0:10\" \"calls the baby\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"0:40\" \"where's the baby\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"1:04\" \"right position\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"1:17\" \"he will sing the baby to sleep\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"1:33\" \"1-2-3\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"1:48\" \"baby downstairs\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"3:12\" \"slaps\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"3:50\" \"1-2-3\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"4:34\" \"you keep an eye on mr Punch\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"4:46\" \"hat\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"5:03\" \"hat\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"5:25\" \"did you see him?\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"5:55\" \"clown\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"6:14\" \"slaps\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"6:52\" \"sausages\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"7:24\" \"crocodile\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"8:07\" \"crocodile + sausages\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"8:32\" \"another scene\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"8:39\" \"fight\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"9:03\" \"clown\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"9:45\" \"mr punch\")




5. Passing options to mplayer
=============================
By default mplayer is called with just a few command-line options,
besides the ones that tell it at what position to start playing -
typically just these for videos,

  -fs -osdlevel 2

to make it run in full-screen mode with an on-screen display
showing the current position, and no options for audio.

If you want to change this you should redefine these functions:

  (ee-mplayer-video-options)
  (ee-mplayer-audio-options)


  



6. Youtube-dl
=============
Videos at Youtube are identified by unique 11-char codes that are
assigned to them when they are uploaded. We will call those 11-char
codes \"hashes\", even though the term is not totally adequade in this
case, and we will explain the main ideas considering the case of an
imaginary video whose title is just TITLE, and whose hash is
\"abcdefghijk\". The URL to access that video at Youtube would be this:

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdefghijk
                                 \\---------/
                                  its hash

If we execute this on a shell,

  cd /tmp/
  youtube-dl -t 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdefghijk'

then youtube-dl would download a local copy of the video; due to the
option \"-t\" (\"--title\"), the name of the local copy would have both
the title of the video and its hash, and, if the video is in MP4
format, that would be

  /tmp/TITLE-abcdefghijk.mp4.part

during the download, and would be renamed to

  /tmp/TITLE-abcdefghijk.mp4

as soon as the download is finished.




7. Downloading a local copy
===========================
Place the point at hash in the URL below,

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdefghijk

and run `M-x find-youtubedl-links'; `find-youtubedl-links' will use
the hash at point as a default for one of its arguments, will run
something equivalent to this sexp,

  (find-youtubedl-links nil nil \"abcdefghijk\")

and will create a buffer like this:

   ___________________________________________________________________________
  |# (find-youtubedl-links \"/tmp/\" \"{title}\" \"abcdefghijk\" \"{ext-}\" \"{stem}\") |
  |# (find-youtubedl-links \"/tmp/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\" nil \"{stem}\")            |

which has LOTS of things... the part

   (eepitch-shell2)
   (eepitch-kill)
   (eepitch-shell2)
  cd /tmp/
  youtube-dl -t 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdefghijk'

is obvious: it is an eepitch script that downloads a local copy
of the video from Youtube.




8. Guessing the title and extension
===================================
Let's simulate what would happen after the eepitch script above -
Execute this:

  (find-sh0 \"rm -v  /tmp/TITLE-abcdefghijk*\")
  (find-sh0 \"echo > /tmp/TITLE-abcdefghijk.mp4.part\")

Now use `M-2 M-e' to compare the buffers generated by two calls
to `find-youtubedl-links' below:

  (find-youtubedl-links nil nil \"abcdefghijk\")
  (find-youtubedl-links \"/tmp/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\")

In the second one we get a buffer where all occurrences
of \"{title}\" have been substituted by \"TITLE\", and all
occurrences of \"{ext-}\" by \".mp4\". What happenned was that

  (ee-youtubedl-guess* \"/tmp/\" \"abcdefghijk\")
     --> (\"/tmp/TITLE-abcdefghijk.mp4.part\")

did find files what that hash string in their names in the
directory \"/tmp/\", and the function `ee-youtubedl-split' has
picked up the first of these file names and has split it into
components:

  (ee-youtubedl-split \"/tmp/TITLE-abcdefghijk.mp4.part\")
     --> (\"/tmp/\" \"TITLE\" \"abcdefghijk\" \".mp4\" \".mp4.part\")

The last of these components is what we will call the \"ext\" -
the \"full extension\" - and the previous one is the \"ext-\" -
the \"extension minus its optional `.part'\". The first three
components are the \"dir\", the \"title\", and the \"hash\".




9. The first lines regenerate the buffer
========================================
The arguments to `find-youtubedl-links' are:

  (find-youtubedl-links DIR TITLE HASH EXT- STEM)

and we just saw how `ee-youtubedl-guess*' and
`ee-youtubedl-split' can be used to guess TITLE, EXT and EXT-
from DIR and HASH.

All the arguments to `find-youtubedl-links' have defaults,
that are used when the received arguments are nil:

  * when HASH is nil, use the youtube hash around point,
    or \"{hash}\" if none;
  * when DIR is nil, use the value of `ee-youtubedl-dir',
    or \"{dir}\" if none;
  * when TITLE or EXT- are nil use the guessing method described
    above, and when they fail use \"{title}\" or \"{ext-}\";
  * when STEM is nil, use \"{stem}\".

The first two lines in a `find-youtubedl-links' regenerate the
buffer, and are usually equivalent to one another. In the buffer
generated by:

  (find-youtubedl-links \"/tmp/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\")

they are:

  (find-youtubedl-links \"/tmp/\" \"TITLE\" \"abcdefghijk\" \".mp4\" \"{stem}\")
  (find-youtubedl-links \"/tmp/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\" nil \"{stem}\")

The first one has only non-nil arguments - all the rules for
guesses and defaults have been applied - where in the second one
TITLE and EXT- are made nil.



10. Selecting a directory
=========================
The second block of lines in the `find-youtubedl-links' buffer
are used to let we switch the directory quickly. If we just
execute `M-x find-youtubedl-links' with the point on our example
hash, or, equivalently, if we do this,

  (find-youtubedl-links nil nil \"abcdefghijk\")

you will see that the first two lines will be:

  (find-youtubedl-links \"~/videos/\" \"{title}\" \"abcdefghijk\" \"{ext-}\" \"{stem}\")
  (find-youtubedl-links \"~/videos/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\" nil \"{stem}\")

which means that the guessing process didn't find a downloaded
copy, as TITLE is \"{title}\" and EXT- is \"{ext-}\". That's because
we are using \"~/videos/\" as the DIR, and our file

  /tmp/TITLE-abcdefghijk.mp4.part

is elsewhere, and the guessing functions only search in one
directory...

The second block contains these sexps,

  (find-youtubedl-links \"~/videos/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\" nil \"{stem}\")
  (find-youtubedl-links \"~/videos/tech/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\" nil \"{stem}\")
  (find-youtubedl-links \"/tmp/videos/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\" nil \"{stem}\")
  (find-youtubedl-links \"/tmp/\" nil \"abcdefghijk\" nil \"{stem}\")

and if we execute the last one we set DIR to \"/tmp/\".

To change the dir strings \"~/videos/\", \"~/videos/tech/\", \"/tmp/videos/\",
\"/tmp/\", that appear in the second block of `find-youtubedl-links'
buffers, change the variables `ee-youtubedl-dir', `ee-youtubedl-dir2',
`ee-youtubedl-dir3', `ee-youtubedl-dir4.'

1. Introduction
===============
In many situations - for example, when we want to script a
debugger, or to test programs that have to talk to one another,
or to control several external machines simultaneously - the
default window setup for eepitch, which is this,

   ____________________
  |          |         |
  |          |         |
  |  script  |  shell  |
  |          |         |
  |          |         |
  |__________|_________|

is not enough; other setups, like these,

   ______________________
  |          |           |        _________________________ 
  |          |  shell A  |       |            |            |
  |          |___________|       |   script   |     GDB    |
  |  script  |           |       |            |            |
  |          |  shell B  |       |____________|____________|
  |          |___________|       |            |            |
  |          |           |       |   program  |   program  |
  |          |  shell C  |       |     I/O    |    source  |
  |__________|___________|       |____________|____________|

may be necessary. Eev comes with a few _low-level_ tools for
creating these setups; they are not very smart, but they should
be easy to understand and to tweak - and I have the impression
that ideas for good high-level tools will only come from
practical experimentation.



2. `find-wset'
==============
Suppose that we are in a buffer A, and we want to create a window
configuration with A at the left, and with the buffers B and C
stacked on one another at the right. That is:

   ___________           ___________ 
  |           |         |     |     |
  |           |         |     |  B  |
  |     A     |   -->   |  A  |_____|
  |           |         |     |     |
  |           |         |     |  C  |
  |___________|         |_____|_____|

To do that from the keyboard we could type this:

  C-x 3   C-x o   C-x b B RET   C-x 2   C-x o   C-x b C RET

You can try that here (the initial `C-x 1' is an extra, for
convenience):

  (eek \"C-x 1         ;; delete-other-windows
        C-x 3         ;; split-window-horizontally (left/right)
        C-x o         ;; other-window              (-> right)
        C-x b B RET   ;; switch to the buffer `B'
        C-x 2         ;; split-window-vertically   (upper/lower)
        C-x o         ;; other-window              (-> lower right)
        C-x b C RET   ;; switch to the buffer `C'
        \")

We can write something equivalent to that as a `progn', in a way
that makes it easy to replace later the `C-x b B RET' and the
`C-x b C RET' by arbitrary sexp hyperlinks. We get:

  (progn (eek \"C-x 1 C-x 3 C-x o\")
         (find-ebuffer \"B\")
         (eek \"C-x 2 C-x o\")
         (find-ebuffer \"C\")
         (eek \"C-x o\")
         )

When I started to rewrite my window configurations into that form
I realized that the `eek's were being used in a very limited way
- they only invoked a very small repertoire of window commands,
all of them starting with `C-x'. So maybe I should have an
interpreter for a simple language of window commands and sexp
hyperlinks, in the which window setup above could be expressed
like this:

  `(\"13o\"
    (find-ebuffer \"B\")
    \"2o\"
    (find-ebuffer \"C\")
    \"o\"
   )

`find-wset' supports something like that, but with all the window
command strings collapsed into a single one, with \"_\"s meaning
\"execute the next sexp from the sexp list\". The corresponding
call to `find-wset' is:

  (find-wset \"13o_2o_o\" '(find-ebuffer \"B\") '(find-ebuffer \"C\"))

For the full list of supported window command characters - and
how to extend it - see the source:

  (find-eev \"eev-multiwindow.el\")




3. High-level words
===================
Very often we want to create window setups like

   _______________            _______________ 
  |       |       |          |       |       |
  |       |       |          |       |   B   |
  |   A   |   B   |    or    |   A   |_______| ;
  |       |       |          |       |       |
  |       |       |          |       |   C   |
  |_______|_______|          |_______|_______|

there are shorthands for that. If you run

  (find-2a sexpA sexpB)

that will create a window setting like the one at the left above,
initially with two copies of the current buffer, then will run
sexpA at the window \"A\" and sexpB at the window \"B\", and
finally will select the window \"A\", i.e., leave the cursor at
the window at the left; this

  (find-2b sexpA sexpB)

will do exactly the same as the `(find-2a ...)' above, but will
select the window \"B\" - the one at the right - at the end of
the process. For three-window settings we have these:

  (find-3a sexpA sexpB sexpC)
  (find-3b sexpA sexpB sexpC)
  (find-3c sexpA sexpB sexpC)

all three create the three-window setting at the right above,
initially with all three windows displaying the current buffer,
then run sexpA at the window \"A\", sexpB at the window \"B\",
and sexpC at the window \"C\"; the difference is that find-3a
selects the window \"A\", find-3b the window \"B\", find-3c the
window \"C\".




4. Several eepitch targets
==========================
If we try to build a window setup like this one, with two eepitch
targets, with just `find-wset', we will run into problems -

   ________________________
  |          |             |
  |          |   *shell*   |
  |  script  |_____________|
  |          |             |
  |          |  *shell 2*  |
  |__________|_____________|

because `(eepitch-shell)' and `(eepitch-shell2)' try to create a
shell buffer and put it in an _another_ window, not the one we
are in... one solution is to call the `(eepitch-*)' sexps inside
an `ee-here', like this:

  (ee-here '(eepitch-shell))
  (ee-here '(eepitch-shell2))

where `ee-here' is a hack that runs a sexp in a way that
preserves the current window configuration, then switches the
buffer in the current selected window to the current eepitch
target. We can use this to create the window setting above,

  (find-wset \"13o2_o_o\"
             ' (ee-here '(eepitch-shell))
             ' (ee-here '(eepitch-shell2))
             )

This is too long - and would make a very bad one-liner - but
there are two shorthands. First, \"e\" is a variant of \"_\" that
runs its sexp inside an `(ee-here ...) - so this is equivalent
the thing above,

  (find-wset \"13o2eoeo\"
             '(eepitch-shell)
             '(eepitch-shell2)
             )

Second, these things are useful enough to deserve a high-level
word, so this is equivalent to:

  (find-3ee '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-shell2))




5. Restarting eepitch targets
=============================
Sometimes we want to do the same as above, but restarting both
eepitch targets, i.e., something like this:

  (find-3ee '(progn (eepitch-shell)  (eepitch-kill) (eepitch-shell))
            '(progn (eepitch-shell2) (eepitch-kill) (eepitch-shell2))
            )

There's a variant of `ee-here' that does that: `ee-here-reset'.
For example,

  (ee-here-reset '(eepitch-shell2))

is equivalent to:

  (ee-here '(progn (eepitch-shell2) (eepitch-kill) (eepitch-shell2)))

and the letter \"E\" is a variant of \"e\" that uses
`ee-here-reset' instead of `ee-here'; also, `find-3EE' is a
variant of `find-3ee' that restarts both targets. Let's adapt
this example,

  (find-eepitch-intro \"3. Other targets\")

to make it show the two eepitch targets at once in a three-window
settings. It becomes:

 (find-3EE '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))
 (eepitch-shell)
echo Hello... > /tmp/o
 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())
 (eepitch-shell)
echo ...and bye >> /tmp/o
 (eepitch-python)
print(open(\"/tmp/o\").read())

 Now compare:
 (eek \"C-x 1\")
 (find-3ee '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))
 (find-3EE '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))



6. Non-trivial examples
=======================
See:

  (find-prepared-intro \"An `ee' for Python\")
  (find-rcirc-intro \"The server buffer and the channel buffers\")



7. Eepitch blocks for two targets
=================================
An eepitch script with two targets uses several different kinds
of red star lines - `(eepitch-target1)', `(eepitch-target2)',
`(find-3EE ...)', `(find-3ee ...)', etc. We don't want to have to
type all those by hand, so there is a hack similar to `M-T' that
generates all those kinds from just \"target1\" and \"target2\"
to let us just copy around the sexps we need. It is bound to
`meta-shift-3', which Emacs sees as `M-#'. Compare the result of
typing `M-T' here,

python

with the result of typing `M-#' on this line,

shell python

which yield this:

 (find-3EE '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))
 (find-3ee '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))
 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-python)

Note that we use to `find-3EE' to restart targets instead of
`eepitch-kill' (this is non-trivial - think about it =/)...



8. Adding support for new characters in `find-wset'
===================================================
The standard characters supported by `find-wset' are these:

  char  action                       key
  ---- ---------------------------- ---------
  `1'  `delete-other-windows'       (C-x C-1)
  `2'  `split-window-vertically'    (C-x C-2)
  `3'  `split-window-horizontally'  (C-x C-3)
  `s'  `split-window-sensibly'
  `o'  `other-window'               (C-x o)
  `+'  `balance-windows'            (C-x +)
  `_'  execute the next sexp

but the action of each one is defined in a different function,
and to add support for a new character, say, `=', we just need to
define a function with the right name - in this case,
`find-wset-='.

The source code is simple enough, so take a look:

  (find-eev \"eev-multiwindow.el\" \"find-wset-_\")
  (find-eev \"eev-multiwindow.el\" \"find-wset-=\")
  (find-eev \"eev-multiwindow.el\" \"find-wset-!\")

Note that `find-wset-!' restarts an eepitch target, while
`find-wset-=' will reuse an eepitch target if its buffer already
exists. [Obs: \"=\" and \"!\" have been mostly superseded by
\"e\" and \"E\"... to do: explain this]


See: (find-prepared-intro)

  [Example at find-prepared-intro]




9. Executing key sequences at other windows
===========================================
It is possible to use multi-window settings, together with the
trick that `<f8>' on a red star line executes it as Lisp and
moves down, to create tutorials for Emacs modes. An example:

  (...)



10. A tutorial for Info mode
============================
Note: this is obsolete! It was superseded by:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"5.1. Navigating the Emacs manuals\")

Here's a mini-tutorial for Info mode, demonstrating how to
navigate in Info using the usual movement keys, plus TAB,
<backtab>, RET, l (last), u (up), n (next), p (prev), q (quit),
C-h i, and the digits 1-9. Note that the display in Info mode is
like this:

   ____________________________________________
  |Next: Nonincremental Search,  Up: Search    | <- next/prev/up
  | (emacs)Top > Search > Incremental Search   | <- breadcrumbs
  |                                            |

  |  (...)                                     |

Recent versions with Emacs come with two IRC clients built-in:
Rcirc and ERC. I never understood ERC well enough, and I found
rcirc quite easy to understand and to hack, so eev has some
support for rcirc (and no support for ERC).

  (find-node \"(rcirc)Top\")
  (find-node \"(erc)Top\")

The eev support for rcirc consists mainly of three high-level
functions that connect to Freenode (the IRC server where most
discussion of free software projects happen), called
`find-freenode', `find-freenode-2a' and `find-freenode-3a'.




1. The example that I use in workshops
======================================
Let's start with an example. In

  (setq rcirc-default-nick \"hakuryo\")
  (setq ee-freenode-ichannels \"#eev\")
  (find-freenode-3a \"#eev\")

the first sexp tells rcirc to use the nickname \"hakuryo\" when
connecting to an IRC server; the second sets the set of \"initial
channels\" on Freenode to just one channel, #eev - a channel that
is usually empty, but that doesn't require authentication; the
third sexp is a \"sexp hyperlink to the Freenode channel #eev\".
The third sexp:

  1) creates a window setting like this,

       _________________________
      |           |             |
      |           |   Freenode  |
      |           |    server   |
      |           |   messages  |
      |  current  |_____________|    
      |  buffer   |             |
      |           |    #eev     |
      |           |   channel   |
      |           |             |
      |___________|_____________|

  2) tells rcirc to connect to Freenode and to the channel #eev
     in it,

  3) makes the window at the left - window \"A\" in the
     terminology of eev-multiwindow.el - the active window. See:

       (find-multiwindow-intro \"3. High-level words\")
       (find-multiwindow-intro \"3. High-level words\" \"find-3a\")

The connection process takes time - about 20 seconds at my
machine - but you will be able to see in window \"B\" the server
messages as they appear, and in window \"C\" the messages of the
#eev channel. You can then use the window \"C\" to interact with
the other users in #eev, and to experiment with commands. See:

  (find-rcircnode \"Internet Relay Chat\" \"Once you have joined a channel\")
  (find-rcircnode \"Getting started with rcirc\" \"To talk in a channel\")
  (find-rcircnode \"rcirc commands\" \"/join #emacs\")




2. The two-window setting
=========================
Try this:

  (find-freenode-2a \"#eev\")

It creates a window setting like

   _________ ________

3. Tracking activity
====================
TODO: explain this:

  (find-rcircnode \"Channels\" \"M-x rcirc-track-minor-mode\")

and how to use it as a one-window setting. Also:

  (find-efunctiondescr 'rcirc-track-minor-mode)
  (find-efunction      'rcirc-track-minor-mode)
  (find-evariable      'rcirc-track-minor-mode-map)

  (find-efunction      'rcirc-next-active-buffer)

  (global-set-key [f2] 'rcirc-next-active-buffer)




4. Commands with very short names
=================================
We can apply this idea

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.4. Commands with very short names\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.4. Commands with very short names\" \"(defun c ()\")

to rcirc. If you connect occasionaly to the channels #eev,
#emacs, #git and #ruby, you can run this, or put these lines in
your .emacs:

  (setq rcirc-default-nick \"hakuryo\")
  (defun e2 () (interactive) (find-freenode-2a \"#eev\"))
  (defun e3 () (interactive) (find-freenode-3a \"#eev\"))
  (defun m2 () (interactive) (find-freenode-2a \"#emacs\"))
  (defun m3 () (interactive) (find-freenode-3a \"#emacs\"))
  (defun g2 () (interactive) (find-freenode-2a \"#git\"))
  (defun g3 () (interactive) (find-freenode-3a \"#git\"))
  (defun r2 () (interactive) (find-freenode-2a \"#ruby\"))
  (defun r3 () (interactive) (find-freenode-3a \"#ruby\"))




5. `find-freenode-links'
========================
You can generate lines like the ones above by running
`find-freenode-links'. For example:

  (find-freenode-links \"e\" \"#eev\")
  (find-freenode-links \"r\" \"#ruby\")

1. Prepared shells
==================
Long before eepitch had been created, eev had another way -
technically much simpler, but clumsier from the user's point of
view - to send commands to external shells (and other shell-like
programs; but to simplify we will say just \"shells\"). Here is
an overview of how it worked: if the user marked the three lines
below,

  rm -Rv /tmp/foo
  mkdir  /tmp/foo/
  cd     /tmp/foo/

and typed `M-x eev' (which stood for \"Emacs-execute-verbosely\")
then Emacs would save those three lines into a temporary script
file, usually \"~/.eev/ee.sh\"; that would be just half of
\"sending commands to an external shell\", and for the other half
the user would have to go to an external prepared shell - that
would usually be running in an xterm, and totally independent
from Emacs - and type \"ee\" there. The shell had to be
\"prepared\" in the sense that it would understand the \"ee\"
command correctly, as meaning: \"execute the commands in the
temporary script as if the user were typing them at the prompt\".
Technically, that would mean that instead of calling
\"~/.eev/ee.sh\" as a shell script its contents would be
\"sourced\" - i.e., executed in the current shell context - and
in verbose mode.

Usually we would prepare bash by patching the file ~/.bashrc and
putting the definition for \"ee\" there. We will discuss how to
do that later; now let's test a simple environment in which `M-x
eev' and \"ee\" work. First execute these two sexps:

  (make-directory \"~/.eev/\" 'force)
  (eev \"rm -Rv /tmp/foo\\nmkdir  /tmp/foo/\\ncd     /tmp/foo/\\n\")

Now run this script

 (eepitch-bash)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-bash)
export PS1='$PWD# '
function ee () { set -v; . ~/.eev/ee.sh; set +v; }



2. `ee'
=======
\[Explain how several interpreters can be programmed to accept
an `ee' command to execute temporary scripts\]

  http://angg.twu.net/eev-article.html#making-progs-receive-cmds

  (find-eev \"eev-langs.el\")
  (find-eev \"eev-bounded.el\")
  (find-eev \"eev-rctool\")




3. An `ee' for Python
=====================
Here is a simple way to make Python execute commands saved in a
temporary script when the user types `ee()' (note that it is not
just `ee' - the `()' is needed). We will show first an example in
which the temporary script is prepared by running \"cat\" from a
shell - then we will explain a more user-friendly way to save a
region from the current buffer as the temporary script.

Note that the demo below uses `find-wset', which is an
advanced (i.e., hackish) feature explained here:

  (find-multiwindow-intro \"Several eepitch targets\")

 (find-3EE '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))
 (find-3ee '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-python))
 (eepitch-python)
import os
def ee():
  execfile(os.getenv(\"HOME\")+\"/.eev/ee.py\", globals())

 (eepitch-shell)
cat > ~/.eev/ee.py <<'%%%'
print(1+2)
%%%

 (eepitch-python)
ee()

 (eepitch-shell)
cat > ~/.eev/ee.py <<'%%%'
def foo (x):
    return x*x

print foo(5)
%%%

 (eepitch-python)
ee()
print(foo(6))



4. `eepy'
=========
The function `eev' receives three parameters, called `s', `e', and
`altfile'; `e' and `altfile' are optional, and `s' should be either a
string or a number. When `s' is a string, then the commands to be
saved into the temporary script are taken from `s'; the numeric case
will be discussed later.

A call to

  (eev \"print(1+2)\" nil \"~/.eev/ee.py\")

writes \"print(1+2)\" (with an added trailing newline, but that's
a technical detail) into the \"alternative file\"
\"~/.eev/ee.py\" - the default would be \"~/.eev/ee.sh\". We can
that to simplify our demo a bit:

 (eek \"C-x 1\")
 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
import os
def ee():
  execfile(os.getenv(\"HOME\")+\"/.eev/ee.py\", globals())

 (eev \"print(1+2)\" nil \"~/.eev/ee.py\")
ee()
 (eev \"def foo (x):\\n    return x*x\\n\\nprint foo(5)\" nil \"~/.eev/ee.py\")
ee()
print(foo(6))


  In the example below the first line defines a `eepy' in a
  simplistic way:

 (defun eepy (s &optional e) (eev s e \"~/.eev/ee.py\"))
 (eek \"C-x 1\")
 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
import os
def ee():
  execfile(os.getenv(\"HOME\")+\"/.eev/ee.py\", globals())

 (eepy \"print(1+2)\")
ee()
 (eepy \"def foo (x):\\n    return x*x\\n\\nprint foo(5)\")
ee()
print(foo(6))




5. `M-x eepy' and `M-x eev'
===========================
Now let's define a more realistic `eepy' - one that can also be
called interactively. We want `M-x eepy' to save the current
_region_ into the temporary script; `eepy' has to be a _command_,
and we will use the argument \"r\" to its `interactive' clause,
to make the function `eepy' receive two numbers - the start and
the end of the region - and it will pass these two numbers to
`eev'.

  (defun eepy (s &optional e)
  \"Save the region between S and E (or the string S) into ~/.eev/ee.py .\"
    (interactive \"r\")
    (eev s e \"~/.eev/ee.py\"))

When the first argument, `s', to `eev', is a number, not a
string, then `eev' expects the second argument, `e', to also be a
number - and then `s' and `e' are considered as the extremities
of a region of text in the current buffer. This idea - that the
first argument can be either a string or a number - comes from:

  (find-efunctiondescr 'write-region \"If START is a string\")

But try these:

  (ee-se-to-string         \"foo\" nil)
  (ee-se-to-string-with-nl \"foo\" nil)
  (ee-se-to-string         \"foo\\n\" nil)
  (ee-se-to-string-with-nl \"foo\\n\" nil)
  (ee-se-to-string         (- (point) 5) (point))
  (ee-se-to-string-with-nl (- (point) 5) (point))
  (ee-se-to-string         (point) (- (point) 5))
  (ee-se-to-string-with-nl (point) (- (point) 5))

executed instead of displayed.




The default bounded function
============================
...is stored in the variable `ee-bounded-function', and can be
re-run with `M-x ee-bounded-function' (i.e., there's a function
with the same name as the variable). I used to bind `f3' to that,
but in modern Emacsen this is bound to a macro key:

  (find-enode \"Basic Keyboard Macro\" \"<F3>\")

so you should do something like this, but for your favourite key:

1. Introduction
===============
Before eepitch had been invented eev had two other ways to send
commands to external shell-like programs. The first way,
described here,

  (find-prepared-intro \"\\n`ee'\\n\")

was technically very simple: running `M-x eev' would save a
series of commands - usually the contents of the region - into a
temporary script file, and then the user would type something
like `ee' at the prompt of a (\"prepared\") shell; that would
make it read the saved commands and execute them.

Here we will describe the second of the Old Ways - one in which
the target program, which is usually a shell running in an xterm,
is sent a signal saying \"execute the command NOW\" as soon as a
command is saved into a temporary file by Emacs. The difficulty
is that this requires not only a directory for temporary files,
but also an Expect script, which acts as an intermediary that
listens to signals and handles them pretending that the saved
commands came from the keyboard... and, as some people have said,
this is \"a nightmare to set up\".

Here we explain the protocol - that can be adapted to other
cases too, like, for example, to make Emacs talk to SmallTalk
environments and to computer algebra systems with GUIs - and we
will present several tests that should help with troubleshooting.





2. Low-level tests
==================
Before we start the theory please try these low-level tests.


2.1. Preparation
----------------
Have have to make sure that:

  1) \"eev-channel.el\" has been loaded,
  2) the \"$EEVDIR/eegchannel\" script exists and is executable,
  3) we have expect installed - eegchannel depends on it,
  4) the temporary directory \"$EEVTMPDIR/\" exists.

Here is an e-script for that:

  (add-to-list 'load-path (ee-expand \"$EEVDIR\"))
  (require 'eev-channel)

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
sudo apt-get install expect
echo     $EEVDIR
cd       $EEVDIR
pwd
wget -nc http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/eegchannel
chmod 755 eegchannel
ls -lAF  $EEVDIR/eegchannel
expect -v
$EEVDIR/eegchannel A echo ok
echo     $EEVTMPDIR
mkdir -p $EEVTMPDIR/

# (find-eev \"eegchannel\")




2.2. Test eegchannel
--------------------
In this test we create a window setting like this,

   ______________________
  |          |           |
  |          |   shell   |
  |  this    |___________|
  |  intro   |           |
  |          |  shell 2  |
  |__________|___________|

and then:

  1) we run \"eegchannel A python\" at the lower shell. This runs
     a python interpreter \"listening on channel A\";

  2) we use the top shell to send the lines \"print(2+3)\" and
     \"exit()\" \"thorugh the channel A\". In low-level terms
     this means that for each line

       a) we save it into the file \"$EEVTMPDIR/eeg.A.str\",

       b) we send a signal SIGUSR1 to the process -
          \"eegchannel\" - whose PID is stored in the file
          \"$EEVTMPDIR/eeg.A.pid\".

       c) When the eegchannel listening on the channel A receives
          a SIGUSR1 it sends the line in \"$EEVTMPDIR/eeg.A.str\"
          to the process that it controls (that is \"python\") \"as
          if the user had typed it\".

Here is the demo. Run it with <F8>s:


 (find-3EE '(eepitch-shell) '(eepitch-shell2))
 (eepitch-shell2)
$EEVDIR/eegchannel A python

 (eepitch-shell)
# Check that eeg.A.pid exists and is very recent:
date
ls -lAF $EEVTMPDIR/eeg.A.*

# Send lines to eegchannel:
echo 'print(2+3)' > $EEVTMPDIR/eeg.A.str
kill -USR1    $(cat $EEVTMPDIR/eeg.A.pid)
echo 'exit()'     > $EEVTMPDIR/eeg.A.str
kill -USR1    $(cat $EEVTMPDIR/eeg.A.pid)



2.3. Test `eechannel'
---------------------
TODO: write this.
See:

  (find-eev \"eev-channels.el\" \"eechannel\")


2.4. Test `eexterm'

3. The innards
==============
Let's start with a detailed low-level view of of what we have
just summarized as to \"save a command into a temporary file,
then send a signal to the external program etc etc\".

of it are just notes, drafts, and links that may not work for
you... =(

4. The protocol, in diagrams
============================
Here's a diagram that shows roughly what we have when X is
running both an Emacs and an xterm, each in a separate window.
Many details have been omitted - for examples, the real
communication happens through fifos and ptys, that are not shown
- but it's easy to build a complete diagram from this. The arrows
indicate flow of information.

                              signals v | signals   
                                  +---------+       
                                  |         |       
                                  |   sh    |       
                                  |         |       
                                  +---------+       

To make the external shell at the right able to receive commands
from Emacs we will insert a program between the \"xterm\" and the
\"sh\" boxes - an Expect script called eechannel, that will
usually be totally transparent, in the sense that it will let all
the chars and signals that it receives pass through it without
changes.

The trick is that \"eechannel\" will also be \"listening to
commands from the outside\", according to the following protocol:

  1) each instance of eechannel \"listens\" to a fixed, named
     \"channel\"; for simplicity, let's suppose that this name is
     \"A\".

  2) When an eechannel receives a signal SIGUSR1 it reads a
     string from the file \"eech.A.str\" and sends that to the
     shell, as if the user had typed that.

  3) To make it simpler to send the signal, when eechannel starts
     up it saves its pid into the file \"eech.A.pid\".

That protocol can be depicted as the four horizontal arrows
below; the temporal order is from top to bottom.

                                    +-------------+
				    |             |
				    |    xterm    |
				    |             |
				    +-------------+
   +-----------+                         |  ^	  
   |           | --> eeg.A.str           v  |     
   |   emacs   | <-- eeg.A.pid      +-------------+
   |           | -----------------> |             |
   +-----------+     eeg.A.str ---> | eechannel A |
                                    |             |
				    +-------------+
                                         |  ^	
				         v  |	
				    +-------------+
				    |             |
				    |     sh      |
				    |             |
				    +-------------+

When Emacs wants to send a line, say, \"cd /tmp/\", to eechannel,
it does this:

  1) \"--> eeg.A.str     \"   writes \"cd /tmp/\" into eech.A.str,
  2) \"<-- eeg.A.pid     \"   reads eechannel's pid from eech.B.str,
  3) \"----------------->\"   sends a signal SIGUSR1 to that pid,
  4) \"    eeg.A.str --->\"   ...and when eechannel receives a SIGUSR1
                                 it reads the contents of eech.A.str and
                                 sends that to its spawned shell.

Actually there's something else - how these programs are started.
If we run just \"xterm\", it behaves in its default way, and runs
a shell. But if we run

  \"xterm -e eechannel A /bin/sh\"

then xterm runs \"eechannel A /bin/sh\" instead of just
\"/bin/sh\"; and \"eechannel A /bin/sh\" runs \"/bin/sh\".

Also, evaluating this

  (find-bgprocess \"xterm\")

from Emacs runs an xterm, which runs a shell; evaluating either
of these sexps,

  (find-bgprocess \"xterm -e eechannel A /bin/sh\")
  (find-bgprocess \"xterm -e eechannel A $SHELL\")

runs an xterm, which runs the \"eechannel\" script, which runs a
shell. The sexp

  (eexterm \"A\")

is a shorthand for the one using \"$SHELL\". Also, note that
\"eechannel A ...\" saves its pid into \"eech.A.pid\".

The diagram that shows what happens when we run `(eexterm \"A\")'
is this one, below - note that the four arrows of the sending
protocol are not shown.

                +------------+

                            |     sh      |
                            |             |
                            +-------------+



5. Downloading and testing eechannel
====================================
Here I'll suppose that the directory \"~/bin/\" exists and is in
your PATH. Run this to download the \"eechannel\" script and make
it executable:

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
cd ~/bin/
# See:  http://angg.twu.net/bin/eechannel.html
wget -n http://angg.twu.net/bin/eechannel
chmod 755 eechannel

Now let's test - from Emacs - if a local copy of \"eechannel\"
exists, is in your PATH, and can be executed (remember that it
needs Expect). Calling \"eechannel\" with not enough arguments
should yield a nice error message.

  (find-fline \"~/bin/eechannel\")
  (find-sh    \"~/bin/eechannel\")
  (find-sh          \"eechannel\")

It uses the environment variable EEVTMPDIR to decide where the
temporary files - ee.CHANNELAME.pid, ee.CHANNELNAME.str - will
be, so let's check that this directory exists:

       (getenv \"EEVTMPDIR\")
  (find-fline \"$EEVTMPDIR/\")

Running eechannel with a first argument \"-v\" should show a lot
of info, and then save the pid at eech.CHANNELAME.pid and run the
given command. Let's try with a command that exits immediately.

  (find-sh \"eechannel -v A /bin/true\")
  (find-fline \"$EEVTMPDIR/\" \"eech.A.pid\")

Now let's verify - using just eepitch, without xterm at this
moment - whether eechannel is being able to receive signals. In
the eepitch script below, two `(find-sh0 \"kill ...\")'s should
each make the controlled program receive a command - at the first
\"kill\" an \"echo 2\", at the second an \"echo 3\".

 (eepitch-comint \"A\" \"eechannel -v A /bin/sh\")
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-comint \"A\" \"eechannel -v A /bin/sh\")
echo 1

 (find-sh0 \"             cat $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.pid\")
 (find-sh0 \"echo 'echo 2'  > $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.str\")
 (find-sh0 \"             cat $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.str\")
 (find-sh0 \"kill -USR1 $(cat $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.pid)\")

 (find-sh0 \"echo 'echo 3'  > $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.str\")
 (find-sh0 \"kill -USR1 $(cat $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.pid)\")
echo 4

If the eepitched shell did run \"echo 1\", \"echo 2\", \"echo
3\", \"echo 4\", then things are working - \"echo 1\" and \"echo
4\" were sent through eepitch, but \"echo 3\" and \"echo 4\" were
sent though channels.

Now let's check if we can run an xterm, and if it can run an
eechannel-ed shell instead of a plain shell. Check if the second
sexp above starts an xterm, displays the info from \"eechannel
-v\", and then runs a shell:

  (find-bgprocess \"xterm\")
  (find-bgprocess \"xterm -e eechannel -v A $SHELL\")
  (find-bgprocess \"xterm -e eechannel    A $SHELL\")

if that worked, run the four sexps below with <f8>,

 (find-sh0 \"echo 'echo 1'  > $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.str\")
 (find-sh0 \"kill -USR1 $(cat $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.pid)\")
 (find-sh0 \"echo 'echo 2'  > $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.str\")
 (find-sh0 \"kill -USR1 $(cat $EEVTMPDIR/eech.A.pid)\")

and check if the eechannel-ed shell in the xterm has received the
commands \"echo 1\" and \"echo 2\". If it did, try the
higher-level version below - but use <f9>s on each line instead
of the <f8>s:

 (eexterm \"A\")
echo 3
echo 4

If that worked, we're done. =)



6. Several xterms
=================
http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/anim/channels.anim.html

 (eexterm \"A\")
 (eexterm \"B\")
# listen on port 1234
netcat -l -p 1234

 (eexterm \"A\")
# Send things to port 1234 (on localhost)
{
  echo hi
  sleep 1
  echo bye
  sleep 1
} | netcat -q O localhost 1234






\[NOT DONE YET. The rest is (recyclable) garbage.\]






\(Old stuff:)

  emacs runs: (find-bgprocess \"xterm -T 'channel A' -e eegchannel A /bin/sh\")
  xterm runs:                                          eegchannel A /bin/sh
  eegchannel saves its pid at ~/.eev/eeg.A.pid and runs:            /bin/sh

At this point the xterm is running a shell that is \"listening on
channel A\"; eegchannel pretends to be transparent and passes all
characters and signals in the vertical arrows transparently - but when
it receives a certain signal (a SIGUSR1) it reads the contents from
the file ~/.eev/eeg.A.str and passes it to the shell, as if those
characters were coming from the xterm - i.e., as if the used had typed
them.

Here are the details of this \"protocol\":
when we type F9 on a line containing \"echo foo\",

  emacs saves the string \"echo foo\\n\" into ~/.eev/A.str,
  emacs reads the pid of eegchannel from ~/.eev/eeg.A.pid (say, \"1022\"),
  emacs runs \"kill -USR1 1022\",
  eegchannel reads the string from ~/.eev/A.str, and sends it to the shell.

NOTE: one frequent question is: \"why are you using two normal files
and SIGUSR1s for the communication between emacs and eegchannel,
instead of making them talk through a fifo?\" - the answer is: try to
explain the details of fifos - including creation - to someone who
knows little about the inner workings of a *NIX kernel and who is
uncomfortable to accept another kind of black box... The way with two
files and SIGUSR1s is simpler, works well enough, and I've been able
to write all the code for it in a few hours - and I still don't know
enough about fifos to implement a fifo version of this.

and another one, that was mostly used to control external
programs running in dedicated xterms. You can see an animation
demonstrating it - and an explanation of what each line does -
here:

This buffer is _temporary_ and _editable_.
It is meant as both a tutorial and a sandbox.



1. What we have now
===================
I am producing a series of videos about eev - but at this moment
only two very broad introductions are ready 8-(. I have plans for
several short videos about specific usage patterns, but don't
hold your breath yet... also, these are my first videos EVER - so
please excuse any stutterings, hesitations and false starts...

The videos are uploaded to Youtube to make them very easy to
find, but Youtube reduces the resolution of the original videos
and makes them blurry and almost unreadable - so the best way to
watch them is to fetch local copies of the high-res .mp4 files.



2. Downloading local copies
===========================
Here are direct links to both the low-res versions at Youtube
and to the corresponding high-res \".mp4\"s:

  Eepitch: a way to control shell-like programs from Emacs
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_zKC5BR64
    http://angg.twu.net/eev-videos/video4-eepitch.mp4

  An introduction to eev2 (2012nov11)
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doeyn5MOaB8
    http://angg.twu.net/eev-videos/video2.mp4 

\(The video about eepitch is shorter and far better than the
other one - please start by it.)

The ideas behind \"local copies\" are here:

  (find-psne-intro)

These sexps generate the download scripts in temporary buffers:

  (find-eev-video-links \"eepitchvideo\" \"video4-eepitch\" \"Lj_zKC5BR64\")
  (find-eev-video-links \"eevvideo\"     \"video2\"         \"doeyn5MOaB8\")




3. Hyperlinks to the local copies of the videos
===============================================
Notice that the download scripts above contain these sexps:

\(code-video \"eepitchvideo\" \"$S/http/angg.twu.net/eev-videos/video4-eepitch.mp4\")
\(code-video \"eevvideo\"     \"$S/http/angg.twu.net/eev-videos/video2.mp4\")

After you execute them hyperlinks like these should work:

  (find-eepitchvideo)
  (find-eevvideo)

Note that they use mplayer to display the videos, and if you
don't have mplayer - or if you haven't downloaded the \".mp4\"s -
then you will get error messages in the \"*Messages*\" buffer.
You can inspect them with `C-x b *Messages*' or with:

  (find-ebuffer \"*Messages*\")




4. Hyperlinks to positions
==========================
The first argument to `find-eepitchvideo' and to other similar
functions is a time offset; it is optional, and it defaults to
\"0:00\". Any further arguments are ignored, and this allows us
to use them as comments. So these two sexps are equivalent:

  (find-eepitchvideo \"0:16\")
  (find-eepitchvideo \"0:16\" \"the eepitch-to-shell-and-python example\")

We could use a series of `find-eepitchvideo' sexps to create a
\"table of contents\" for a video, similarly to what we do for
written documents...



5. Time offsets as hyperlinks to positions
==========================================
In some cases using sexps creates too much visual clutter, and we
would like to be able to create an index or table of contents
writing lines just like this,

  0:16  the eepitch-to-shell-and-python example

instead of using explicit elisp hyperlinks.

There is a way to do this, but it is tricky. It involves
activating a mode, called `eev-avadj-mode', in which `M-p' is
bound to a command that locates the first thing looking like a
time offset in the current line, and calls the video player to
make it play the *current default video* starting from that time
offset; a sexp like

  (find-eepitchvideo t)

just sets the current default video, but does not invoke the
player. All this is explained here:

  (find-audiovideo-intro \"The time-from-bol\")




6. Eepitch video: table of contents

9. Comparison with youtube
==========================
Note that Youtube has a trick that lets we use URLs that point to
specific positions in videos. For example, this,

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_zKC5BR64&t=0m16s

makes the video about eepitch start at 0:16 instead of from the
beginning. Also, each video at Youtube can have uploader comments
and a discussion, and in the text of these comments things like
\"12:34\" become links that make the current video skip to that
position.

  (find-audiovideo-intro)



10. Video2pt: Uma introducao ao eev2 (2012nov15)
================================================
This is a version in Portuguese of the video above.
It is slightly longer than the version in English because it's
intended mostly for non-Emacsers, so some things are explained
\(much) more slowly...

Note: this intro needs to be rewritten!
I wrote it for a mini-tutorial on Lisp that I gave.
It complements this:
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"2. Evaluating Lisp\")
  (find-eval-intro \"3. What to execute, and in what order\")
  (find-eval-intro \"3. What to execute, and in what order\" \"defun\")




Simple examples
===============

  (* 5 5)
  (* 6 6)
  (defun foo (a) (* a a))
  (foo 5)
  (foo 6)

  (+ 5 5)
  (defun foo (a) (+ a a))
  (foo 5)

  (symbol-function 'foo)
  ((lambda (a) (* a a)) 5)
  ((lambda (a) (+ a a)) 5)

See:
  (find-elnode \"Function Cells\")
  (find-elnode \"Defining Functions\")



Several arguments
=================

  (defun foo (a b) (+ (* a a) (* b b)))
  (foo 10 2)
  (foo 5)
  (defun foo () (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5)))
  (foo 10 2)
  (foo 5)
  (foo)



progn and prog1
===============
The body of a \"defun\" works like a \"progn\".
See: (find-elnode \"Index\" \"* progn:\")

  (defun foo (a b)         (* a b))
  (defun foo (a b) (+ a b) (* a b))
  (defun foo (a b) (* a b) (+ a b))
  (defun foo (a b)         (+ a b))
  (foo 5 6)

  (progn   (* 5 6) (+ 5 6))
  (progn \"ignored\" (+ 5 6) \"result\")
  (progn)

  (prog1   (* 5 6) (+ 5 6))
  (prog1 \"result\" (+ 5 6) \"ignored\")
  (prog1)



Docstrings
==========
Note that a string in a (progn ...) does nothing - unless it is
the last BODY-FORM.

But see: (find-elnode \"Documentation\")

Try:

  (defun foo (a b) \"IGNORED\" (+ a b))
  (defun foo (a b) \"This is the description of `foo'\" (+ a b))
  (defun foo (a b) \"This is the docstring of `foo'\" (+ a b))
  (defun foo (a b) \"This function returns (* A B). Note the italics!\" (+ a b))
  (find-efunctiondescr 'foo)



&optional and &rest
===================
See: (find-elnode \"Argument List\")
Try:

  (defun foo (a &optional b c) (list \"a,b,c:\" a b c))
  (foo 11 22 33)
  (foo 11 22)
  (foo 11)
  (foo)
  (foo 11 22 33 44)

  (defun foo (a &optional b c &rest r) (list \"a,b,c,r:\" a b c r))
  (foo 11 22 33 44 55 66)
  (foo 11 22 33 44 55)
  (foo 11 22 33 44)
  (foo 11 22 33)
  (foo 11 22)
  (foo 11)
  (foo)

  (defun foo (a &rest r) (list \"a,r:\" a r))
  (foo 11 22 33 44)
  (foo 11 22 33)
  (foo 11 22)
  (foo 11)
  (foo)



A tool: my-insert
=================
See: (find-elnode \"Formatting Strings\")
Try:

  (format \"<%s>\" \"hello\")
  (format \"<%s>\" \"123\")
  (format \"<%s>\" 123)
  (format \"<%s>\" 'hello)
  (format \"<%s>\" '(+ 2 3))

  (format \"<%S>\" \"hello\")
  (format \"<%S>\" \"123\")
  (format \"<%S>\" 123)
  (format \"<%S>\" 'hello)
  (format \"<%S>\" '(+ 2 3))

Now define:

  (defun my-insert (obj)
    \"Print (insert) OBJ in the current buffer.\"
    (insert (format \"\\n  ;; \\\\--> %S\" obj)))

Try:

  (my-insert 123)
  (my-insert \"123\")
  (my-insert \"hello\")
  (my-insert 'hello)
  (my-insert '(+ 2 3))
  (my-insert nil)
  (my-insert '())
  (my-insert ())

  (find-elnode \"General Escape Syntax\")



interactive
===========
Not all Emacs functions are callable with `M-x' - only those that
are \"commands\" are callable in this way. And only \"commands\"
can be bound to keys...

See:
  (find-elnode \"Defining Functions\" \"the first two of the BODY-FORMS\")
  (find-elnode \"Defining Commands\")
  (find-elnode \"Command Overview\")

When you execute an `(interactive ...)' it does nothing - it
simply ignores its arguments (which aren't even evaluated!) and
returns nil. But just as 


  (defun my-insert (obj) (insert (format \"\\n  ;; \\\\--> %S\" obj)))

  (find-efunctiondescr 'interactive)

  (eek \"M-x foo\")
  (commandp 'foo)

  (defun foo (&rest rest) (interactive) (bar rest))
  (eek \"M-x foo\")

  (defun foo (&rest rest)                   (bar rest))
  (defun foo (&rest rest) (interactive \"P\") (bar rest))
  (eek \"            M-x foo\")
  (eek \"M-1         M-x foo\")
  (eek \"M-1 M-2 M-3 M-x foo\")
  (eek \"M-- M-2 M-3 M-x foo\")

  (defun foo (&rest rest) (interactive \"R\") (bar rest))
  (eek \"M-x foo\")

THIS INTRO IS OBSOLETE, and has been superseded by:
  (find-emacs-keys-intro)



Basic keys (eev)
================
The most basic keys of eev are:
  M-e   - to follow a hyperlink, see: (find-eval-intro \"Elisp hyperlinks\")
  M-k   - to go back,            see: (find-eval-intro \"\\nGoing back\")
  M-j   - to jump to certain predefined places - in particular,
         `M-j' takes you to the list of jump targets.
        `M-2j' takes you to this help page.
        `M-5j' takes you to: (find-eev-intro)
         See: (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.1. `eejump'\")
              (find-eejump-intro \"Families\")
  M-h M-h - hyperlinks to here, plus help.
         See: (find-links-intro \"`find-here-links'\")


The mnemonics are:
  M-e   - evaluate/execute
  M-j   - jump
  M-k   - kill buffer

It is possible to start learning Emacs and eev by remembering
only that `M-j' jumps to an index; when you're lost, type `M-j',
and will see a reminder of the main keys and of the main jump
targets - after that you can learn how to use `M-k' to kill the
top buffer, and `M-e' to follow elisp hyperlinks. The other keys
are explained in \"intros\" like this one.




Files, Buffers, Windows, Frames, Display, etc
=============================================
Emacs can edit several files at the same time, each one
in a \"buffer\".

  (find-enode \"Files\")
  (find-enode \"Buffers\")
  (find-enode \"Windows\")
  (find-enode \"Frames\")

The display of Emacs looks like this (asciified):
                                        __ _ _
              ______________emacs_______\\/|-|X|
          /  |                                 |  \\
          |  | bla.                            |  | Emacs
Window    |  |                                 |  | calls this
managers  |  |                                 |  | a \"window\".
call      |  |                                 |  /
this a    |  |--:** foo.txt  (Fundamental) ----|  <-- Its \"modeline\".
\"window\". /  |                                 |  \\
Emacs     \\  | bla bla.                        |  | Another
calls     |  | bleh                            |  | window.
this a    |  |                                 |  |
\"frame\".  |  |                                 |  /
          |  |--:** bar.txt  (Fundamental) ----|  <-- Its modeline.
          \\  |Find file: ~/bletch.txt_ ________|  <-- The minibuffer.

The bottom line of a frame is sometimes the \"echo area\",
sometimes the \"minibuffer\". The minibuffer acts like a
window when it is active, and `C-x o' can be used to move
from it to the \"normal windows\" and back. You can also
use the mouse to move between windows.

  (find-enode \"Echo Area\")
  (find-enode \"Minibuffer\")
  (find-enode \"Other Window\")

By default there's also a \"menu bar\" (with textual entries) and
a \"tool bar\" (with icons) at the top of each frame, but
advanced users usually disable them.

  (find-enode \"Menu Bar\")
  (find-enode \"Tool Bars\")




Basic keys (Emacs)
==================
\(find-enode \"Keys\" \"key sequence\")
\(find-enode \"User Input\" \"`Control-a'\" \"usually written `C-a'\")
\(find-enode \"User Input\" \"<META> key\")
\(find-enode \"Completion\" \"<TAB>\")

<ESC> <ESC> <ESC>               (find-enode \"Quitting\")
C-g   keyboard-quit             (find-enode \"Quitting\" \"`C-g'\")

M-x   execute-extended-command  (find-enode \"M-x\" \"Running Commands by Name\")



Cutting & pasting
=================
The \"region\" where cut & copy operate is always what is between
the \"point\" and the \"mark\":

  (find-enode \"Point\")
  (find-enode \"Mark\")

You can do cut, copy and paste by using the icons in the toolbar
or by using the menu bar (the relevant options are under
\"Edit\"), but the keys are worth learning:

  C-SPC   -- set-mark-command           (find-enode \"Setting Mark\")
  C-x C-x -- exchange-point-and-mark    (find-enode \"Setting Mark\" \"C-x C-x\")
  C-w     -- kill-region     (cut)      (find-enode \"Other Kill Commands\")
  M-w     -- kill-ring-save  (copy)     (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")
  C-y     -- yank            (paste)    (find-enode \"Kill Ring\")



Undoing
=======
C-/    -- undo    (find-enode \"Basic Undo\")
C-_    -- undo    (find-enode \"Basic Undo\")
                  (find-enode \"Undo\")


Windows
=======
See: (find-enode \"Frames\")
     (find-enode \"Windows\")
C-x o   -- other-window                      (find-enode \"Other Window\")
C-x 0   -- delete-window                     (find-enode \"Change Window\")
C-x 1   -- delete-other-windows (\"1 window\") (find-enode \"Change Window\")
C-x 2   -- split-window-vertically (Abv/Blw) (find-enode \"Split Window\")
C-x 3   -- split-window-horizontally   (L|R) (find-enode \"Split Window\")

Eev does some things similar to Org, but using a different
approach and different design principles. This sandboxed tutorial
is a _first attempt_ to show to Org users how to use Org and eev
at the same time, in the same files (or buffers).

Note: I wrote this after giving a presentation about eev in the
EmacsConf 2019 and getting some help from Org users there (mainly
Amin Bandali). Link:

  http://angg.twu.net/emacsconf2019.html




1. Preparation
==============
Run these sexps:

  (code-c-d \"org\" (ee-locate-library \"org.el\") \"org\" :gz)
  (require 'org)
  (require 'ob-sh)
  ;; or: (require 'ob-shell)
  (require 'ob-python)



2. Toggling org-mode on and off
===============================
Use these sexps,

  (org-mode)
  (fundamental-mode)

or `M-x org-mode' and `M-x fundamental-mode'.



3. Comment blocks
=================
If you are using an org file that is meant for exporting you can
mark as comments the more eev-ish parts in it, like this...

# (find-orgnode \"Comment lines\")
# (find-orgnode \"Exporting\")

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
# Run the eepitch block below to download a copy of my messy
# notes on org. See:
# (find-eev-quick-intro \"6. Controlling shell-like programs\")

 (eepitch-shell)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-shell)
cd /tmp/
rm -fv org.e
wget http://angg.twu.net/e/org.e

#+END_COMMENT




4. Running code from my org.e
=============================
The code in comments in the previous section downloads a local
copy of my executable notes (i.e., my \"e-scripts\") on Org. Run
it, and compare:

# http://angg.twu.net/e/org.e.html#git
# (find-anchor \"/tmp/org.e\" \"git\")

The URL above points to my notes on downloading Org from git and
compiling its docs. The sexp hyperlinks below it lets you execute
these notes.




5. Evaluating source blocks
===========================
You can execute a source block in Org and display its results
with `C-c C-c'. See:

# (find-orgnode \"Working With Source Code\")
# (find-orgnode \"Evaluating code blocks\")

Try it here:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
seq 200 204
#+END_SRC

Compare that with:

# (find-sh \"seq 200 204\")

and compare

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def square (x):
    return x*x

print(square(5))
#+END_SRC

with:

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
 (eepitch-python)
 (eepitch-kill)
 (eepitch-python)
def square (x):
    return x*x

print(square(5))

#+END_COMMENT




5. Sectioning
=============
Not yet!
How do I mark a section as \"don't export this\"?

  (find-orgnode \"Headlines\")
  (find-orgnode \"Global and local cycling\")
  (find-efunctiondescr 'org-mode \"TAB\" \"org-cycle\")

This intro will be merged with
  (find-here-links-intro)
at some point...



Eev's central idea is that you can keep \"executable logs\" of
what you do, in a format that is reasonably readable and that is
easy to \"play back\" later, step by step and in any order. We
call these executable logs \"e-scripts\".

We will start this intro by explaining how eev and e-scripts
appeared. Then we will see how to read and play back a sample
e-script, and understand its conventions; then we will see some
tools to help writing e-scripts in several usual formats:

  1) a file with hyperlinks and eepitch blocks,
  2) a file with e-script blocks and an index,
  3) several files with e-script blocks and indexes,
  4) source files with eepitch blocks in multi-line comments,
  5) temporary buffers, like the ones generated by
     `find-latex-links' and `find-lua-links'.




1. Prehistory
=============
Eev appeared by accident. I started using Emacs in 1994 or 1995.
I knew a bit of Lisp from a course in the university, and after
just a few hours using Emacs I started putting sexps like this in
my notes,

  (find-file \"/usr/share/emacs/19.24/lisp/\")
  (find-file \"/usr/share/emacs/19.24/lisp/files.el\")

to go quickly to files or directories that I found interesting. A
few days after that I wrote a function - that I could invoke as
`M-x eev' - that saved the text of the region in the file
\"~/ee.sh\", and I had an alias `ee' in my shell that would
execute the contents of that file in verbose mode, i.e., showing
each line before executing it. \"Eev\" meant
\"Emacs-execute-verbosely\", but `M-x eev' only saved a block of
commands into \"~/ee.sh\"; to execute them I had to switch to a
terminal and type \"ee\". If the function `eev' was called with a
string argument instead of being called interactively it would
write that string to \"~/ee.sh\"; a sexp like

  (eev \"man tar\")

was a very primitive hyperlink to the manpage for \"tar\". I
wrote extensions to these ideas gradually, and for YEARS I was
absolutely sure that Emacs was meant to be used exactly in that
way, and that EVERYBODY used elisp code as hyperlinks. At some
point in 1999 I sent a message to a mailing list about Emacs, and
I casually apologized for using my own functions - with weird
names - for elisp hyperlinks and for saving code to be sent to a
shell, and asked where in the elisp source files I could find the
standard function that did that.

RMS himself answered.

He said that no one else was using Emacs in that way; that that
was very interesting, and that someone should clean up and
document my code so that it could be included in Emacs.

Eev is not yet an official part of Emacs (long story!) and
eepitch practically replaced `M-x eev' as a way to execute shell
commands. For more on `M-x eev', see: (find-prepared-intro)





2. E-scripts
============
The best short definition for eev that I've found involves some
cheating, as it is a circular definition: \"eev is a library that
adds support for e-scripts to Emacs\" - and e-scripts are files
that contain chunks meant to be processed by eev's functions.
Almost any file can contain parts \"meant for eev\": for example,
a HOWTO or README file about some program will usually contain
some shell commands, and we can use `M-x eev' or eepitch to send
these commands to a shell; most of my own files contain lots of
elisp hyperlinks, and some of them even contain eepitch blocks
inside multi-line comments - for example, this Lua library:

  http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/dednat6/eoo.lua.html#Vector

Some of my files are \"pure e-scripts\": they are mostly made of
\"e-script blocks\" like the ones described here:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"8.4. Creating e-script blocks\")

Here are two examples structured like this:

  http://angg.twu.net/e/emacs.e.html
  http://angg.twu.net/e/lua5.e.html

Each of these \"e-script blocks\" is an \"executable log\" of
something that I was trying to understand, or trying to do.




3. Sharing
==========
One of my first public texts about eev was the \"Eev Manifesto\":

  http://angg.twu.net/eev-manifesto.html

Here are its main parts.

  Everybody is fluent in only a small fraction of all Unix
  commands. If you could \"listen\" to how the Unix gurus
  \"speak\" to their machines you would learn which \"words\" are
  related to solving a particular task, and learn how they fit in
  \"sentences\". By checking the \"dictionary entries\" for
  them (i.e., manpages, info pages, READMEs, source code, etc)
  you could learn the real meaning of them. But then you'd be
  learning Unix by immersion, from real use, instead of having to
  rely only on \"textbooks\", \"dictionaries\" and sometimes
  \"Rosetta stones\", \"graffitis on toilet walls\" and \"old
  newspapers\".

  The fact is that you can make a record of how you \"speak\"
  Unix, and more, you can become a lot more productive if you do
  so. Many tasks consist on short fixed sequences of commands:
  connecting to your ISP via modem, unpacking a source package
  and recompiling it, printing a text file in two-column mode,
  and so on. The trick is that with some functions defined in
  eev.el you can write these sequences of commands in a plain
  text file, then mark a block of this file with your
  editor (which must be Emacs for this to work), then tell a
  shell to execute only the commands in that block; in this way
  you can easily execute only portions of what would otherwise
  have to be a monolythic script; this is great for when you're
  not sure if everything works, or if you just want to do some
  steps. Also, it would be easy to change bits of the \"script\"
  before execution, as you'll be doing things from inside an
  editor.

  (...)

  I have placed essentially all my \"scripts\" written in this
  way (I call them \"e-scripts\") in a public place. They contain
  almost everything I know about Unix.

  If you like this idea, please get in touch, send comments, ask
  questions -- about e-scripts or questions whose answer could
  become an e-script chunk -- or send me your e-scripts when you
  have some, or even ask for help on setting up your own e-script
  collection or e-script public site... anything! By asking good
  questions you can help me make the documentation get better.

  I really want to make this e-scripts idea spread. Learning Unix
  -- or simply more Unix -- could be made easier for everybody...
  please help! E-scripts are more fun to use, and easier to
  write, than texts that tell everything in terms of \"press
  this, do that\". A lot of effort and money are being invested
  now on these kinds of text, and they're often very depressing.
  Let's try to save the world from them, at least a bit, and
  maybe this money will be directed to better things. And
  teaching people Unix tricks will be both easier and more fun.

The Manifesto said that

  1) *NIX can be compared to an oral language,
  2) we can \"write\" the commands that we \"speak\",
  3) we learn mostly by \"listening\", or \"reading\", others,
  4) we have good reasons to write:

     a) executable logs make us more productive,
     b) our notes/logs can, and should, be shared.

What it *did not* say explicitly was:

  5) that *not sharing* should be *immoral*,
  6) one of my main objectives with eev was REVENGE.

I spent (what felt like) hundreds of hours in the university
trying to learn things with the *NIX users and gurus there - to
practically no avail. They answered very few of my questions,
they only very rarely showed me their code or notes, and I can
remember only a handful of cases in which we sat side-by-side on
a terminal.

These people - who shared very little - were the most respected
hackers of that place.

They had to be stripped of their status.





4. How to read an e-script
==========================
The indented block below between the two \"snip, snip\" lines -
we will call it \"Example 1\" - exemplifies most of the basic
techniques available for e-scripts. These techniques will be
reviewed in the subsections below.

4.1. Anchors and `to'
---------------------
The two lines below

  # «.foo»	 (to \"foo\")
  # «foo» 	(to \".foo\")

\"point to one another\". This is explained here:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"8. Anchors\")

We used this in Example 1 to create an index. Compare with:

  # Index:
  # «.one»	(to \"one\")
  # «.two»	(to \"two\")

  ###
  ## Stuff in block \"one\"
  ###

  # «one» (to \".one\")
  (...)

  ###
  ## Stuff in block \"two\"
  ###

  # «two» (to \".two\")



4.2. Debian hyperlinks
----------------------
The hyperlinks using `find-status', `find-vldifile', and
`find-udfile' are hyperlinks to information about a Debian
package. These hyperlinks

  (find-status   \"bash\")
  (find-vldifile \"bash.list\")
  (find-udfile   \"bash/\")

are equivalent to:

  (find-fline \"/var/lib/dpkg/status\" \"\\nPackage: bash\\n\")
  (find-fline \"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.list\")
  (find-fline \"/usr/share/doc/bash/\")

See:

  (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\" \"find-Package\")
  (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\" \"find-Package\" \"find-status\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"9.1. `code-c-d'\" \"(code-c-d \\\"ud\\\"\")
  (find-eev \"eev-code.el\" \"code-c-d-s\")
  (find-eev \"eev-code.el\" \"code-c-d-s\" \"(code-c-d \\\"ud\\\"\")
  (find-eev \"eev-code.el\" \"code-c-d-s\" \"(code-c-d \\\"vldi\\\"\")



4.3. URL hyperlinks
-------------------
The lines

  # http://www.lua.org/docs.html
  # http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html
  # file:///usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/doc/manual.html

are URL hyperlinks. Here's how to follow them:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"3.1. Non-elisp hyperlinks\")

Note that the \"file:///\" URL above points to a local copy of
the Lua manual at \"http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html\" -
but the local copy will only exist if the Debian package
\"lua5.1-doc\" is installed.



4.4. Eepitch blocks
-------------------
This

   (eepitch-shell)
   (eepitch-kill)
   (eepitch-shell)
  sudo apt-get install lua5.1 lua5.1-doc

is an \"eepitch block\", as explained here:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"6. Controlling shell-like programs\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"6.1. The main key: <F8>\")

Note that it will only work if you delete the whitespace before
the \"\"s!



4.5. Htmlized e-scripts
-----------------------
The \"Eev Manifesto\" in section 3 above has this:

  I have placed essentially all my \"scripts\" written in this
  way (I call them \"e-scripts\") in a public place. They contain
  almost everything I know about Unix.

The \"public place\" is here:

  http://angg.twu.net/e/

The links

  # http://angg.twu.net/e/lua-intro.e.html
  # http://angg.twu.net/e/lua-intro.e

point to one of these e-scripts - one that I use to teach (or
introduce) Lua to people that already know other programming
languages. The

  # http://angg.twu.net/e/lua-intro.e.html

point to an \"htmlized version\" of it, in which many of the
hyperlinks are converted to something that works in a browser.
The header of the .html explains briefly how the htmlized version
is produced.




4.6. The `rm' in the eepitch block
----------------------------------
When we execute this eepitch block a first time,

   (eepitch-shell)
   (eepitch-kill)
   (eepitch-shell)
  cd /tmp/
  rm -v lua-intro.e
  wget http://angg.twu.net/e/lua-intro.e

the \"rm\" gives an error:

  rm: cannot remove 'lua-intro.e': No such file or directory

When we execute it a second, third, fourth time, the \"rm\"
deletes the file \"/tmp/lua-intro.e\" that the wget downloaded in
the previous run.

I usually write my eepitch blocks a few lines at a time, and I
test the new lines by running the whole block again from the
beginning. This means that for me most of the time a line like

  rm -v lua-intro.e

does not give an error - and I got used to ignoring the error
when it's run for the first time.

Most e-scripts in

  http://angg.twu.net/e/

follow these conventions:

  1) they can be re-run,
  2) they start with clean-up code,
  3) I prefer to write the clean-up code to be short, even when
     this means that I will have to ignore errors and warnings.




4.7. A convention about order
-----------------------------
(Explain why I feel natural to put the eepitch block that
installs the lua5.1 packages at the end of the first e-script
block, after the hyperlinks to files from that package)








5. Tools for writing e-scripts
==============================
One of my favorite ways of describing eev is as a \"tool to
create executable logs\", but this only make sense if we clarify
some ideas and terms.

The e-script in Example 1 has two _e-script blocks_ plus an
_index_. The fist block has notes about installing the packages
for Lua5.1 in Debian and inspecting them, and the second block is
about downloading and using an eev-based Lua tutorial. Let's
think of each of these blocks as a _task_.

The task \"install Lua5.1\" is performed in one way if we're
doing it for the first time, and in a different way if we're
doing it for the n-th time with some memory of what we did in the
previous times and of what we found important and what not.
Performing a task like this consists of several steps, that can
be roughly divided into \"visiting\" and \"commands\". I borrowed
the term \"visiting\" from Emacs:

  (find-enode \"Visiting\" \"Visiting Files\")

Look at the first block of Example 1 again. It has several elisp
hyperlinks to information about the packages \"lua5.1\" and
\"lua5.1-doc\". Following those hyperlinks let us \"visit\" the
descriptions of the two packages, their lists of files, and some
of their directories. Then the e-script block has three URL links
to the Lua documentation in general and to its reference manual,
and then an eepitch block that runs an \"apt-get install\".

We saw how to follow links and how to execute eepitch blocks, so
an e-script block is \"executable\". But in what sense it is a
\"log\"?

  1. In the old days log books were always made of paper, and
     there was nothing automatic in taking notes with them. We
     would have to decide what to write and how to write it, and
     we would have to alternate between the \"task\" and \"taking
     notes\". After many years of practice _some_ people would
     learn how to take notes without distracting themselves much
     from the task at hand, and they would learn how to make
     their notes at the same time concise and readable enough.

  2. Nowadays, with computers, there are _some_ ways to write
     logs automatically - for example, most shells record the
     commands given to them - but the output is of low quality.

  3. Eev takes an intermediate stance between \"notes by hand\"
     and \"automatic notes\". It is possible to do
     \"task\"+\"notes\" with just a few more keystrokes than for
     doing just \"task\", but that requires learning some tricks,
     and having some practice.

The next sections discuss those tricks.





5.1. Anchors-to pairs and e-script blocks
-----------------------------------------
Anchor-to pairs can be generated easily using `M-A':

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"8.3. Creating index/section anchor pairs\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"8.3. Creating index/section anchor pairs\" \"M-A\")

Typing `M-A' on this line:

  # <bletch>

yields this pair of anchor-to lines:

  # «.bletch»	(to \"bletch\")
  # «bletch»	(to \".bletch\")

let's call the first one a \"to-forward\" and the second one a
\"to-back\". In my e-scripts files I follow the convention that
the to-forwards are all together at the beginning of the file,
forming an index of sections of the file, and each to-back is at
the beginning of a section. Most of the source files of eev
follow this convention; see, for example:

  (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\" \".eek\")
  (find-eev \"eev-blinks.el\" \"eek\")

Note that there, and in most source files of eev, above each
to-back line there a title in big letters in ASCII art in Lisp
comments.

After creating a to-forward-to-back pair with `M-A' we have to
move the to-forward line to the index by hand, using cut and
paste.

In the e-script files in

  http://angg.twu.net/e/

I follow another convention - \"e-script blocks\". The title
above each to-backward line is written like this:

  #####
  #
  # Long description for the section Bletch
  # 2016feb29
  #
  #####

Note that you can generate a title in \"#\"s like that, followed
by a to-forward-to-back pair, by typing `M-B' on a line like:

  bletch Long description for the section Bletch

See:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"8.4. Creating e-script blocks\")
  (find-eev-quick-intro \"8.4. Creating e-script blocks\" \"`M-B'\")

The to-forward line still has to be moved to the index by cut and
paste by hand.




5.2. Debian hyperlinks
----------------------
The key `M-D' converts a line with the name of a Debian package,
like this,

lua5.1-doc

to these three hyperlinks,

# (find-status   \"lua5.1-doc\")
# (find-vldifile \"lua5.1-doc.list\")
# (find-udfile   \"lua5.1-doc/\")

and moves the point to the next line. Try it! Put the point on
the \"bash\" line below and type `M-D M-D M-D':

bash
lua5.1
lua5.1-doc




5.3. URL hyperlinks
-------------------
I usually \"write\" URLs in Emacs by copying them from a browser
to Emacs.



5.4. Eepitch blocks
-------------------
We saw in 

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"6.3. Creating eepitch blocks: `M-T'\")

how to create eepitch blocks with `M-T'. Try that on the line
that says \"lua51\" below:

lua51



5.5. `rm/mkdir/cd' triples
--------------------------
Try typing `M-R' on the line with the \"/tmp/foo/\" below:

/tmp/foo/




5.6. Hyperlinks to files, directories, and info nodes
-----------------------------------------------------
One practical way to create a `find-fline' hyperlink is with
`M-F' (`eewrap-find-fline'). Try it here:

/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/test/
/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/test/README
/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/test/fibfor.lua

Note that the three lines above were copied from:

  (find-vldifile \"lua5.1-doc.list\")
  (find-vldifile \"lua5.1-doc.list\" \"/usr/share/doc/lua5.1-doc/test\")

Another way is by visiting a file and typing `M-h M-h'. See:

  (find-eev-quick-intro \"4.1. `find-here-links'\")

This can also be used to generate links to info nodes.

  The three basic keys of eev:
  A mini tutorial
    Eduardo Ochs
    http://angg.twu.net/#eev
    http://angg.twu.net/#eev-three-main-keys
    (Version: 2019aug09)

  Eev's central idea is that you can keep \"executable logs\" of
  what you do, in a format that is reasonably readable and that is
  easy to \"play back\" later, step by step and in any order.

  The is the second of the mini-tutorials.
  The first one was on a way to install eev \"for total beginners\"
  that creates a script called ~/eev that starts Emacs with eev-mode on
  and opens the main sandboxed tutorial of eev:

    (find-eev-quick-intro)

  The `(find-*-intro)'s are interactive tutorials.
  The mini-tutorials are videos.
  This mini-tutorial is about the basic ideas that you need to understand
  to run the interactive tutorials.
                                       ^
                                       |
                                  three keys!



  In Emacs terminology `C-e' is `control-e',
                   and `M-e' is `alt-e'.
          We pronounce `M-e' as `meta-e'.
  Some old keyboards had a \"meta key\".
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_key

  Some keys in Emacs recognize numeric prefixes.
  For example, `M-4 M-2 a' inserts 42 `a's.

  Lisp is a programming language that uses:
    1. lots of lists
    2. lots of parentheses - they delimit the lists
    3. no \",\"s between the elements of these lists
    4. the name of a function at the beginning of the list,
       the arguments for the function after that.

  These lists without commas are called \"sexps\".
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexp

  These sexp are Lisp expressions (programs!):

       (* 2 3)
               (* 4 5)
    (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))

  they return these results:

       (* 2 3)            --> 6
               (* 4 5)    --> 20
    (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))   --> 26

  This is a sexp with \"side effects\":

    (insert \"HELLO\")


  SPOILER: The basic keys of eev are:

  M-e   - to follow an elisp hyperlink. (Elisp = Emacs Lisp)
          Mnemonic: \"(e)valuate\"/\"(e)xecute\".
  M-k   - to go back.  Mnemonic: \"(k)ill buffer\".
  M-j   - to (j)ump to certain predefined places. For example:

       M-2 M-j  runs:  (find-emacs-keys-intro)
       M-5 M-j  runs:  (find-eev-quick-intro)
           M-j  takes you to the list of jump targets.

  You just need to learn `M-e', `M-k' and `M-j' keys to navigate:
    1. the sandboxed tutorials for eev,
    2. the list of all most important keys,
    3. and the Emacs manuals!

  This mini-tutorial is BASED on these parts of the main tutorial:
    (find-eev-quick-intro)
    (find-eev-quick-intro \"2. Evaluating Lisp\")
    (find-eev-quick-intro \"3. Elisp hyperlinks\")
    (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.1. `eejump'\")
    (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.1. `eejump'\" \"numeric arguments\")





2. Evaluating Lisp
==================
When you type `M-e' emacs moves the point to the end of the
current line, then runs a variant of `C-x C-e'. Try this on each
line of the block below:

  (+ (* 2 3)
     (* 4 5)
     )

`M-e' accepts several different numeric prefixes that alter its
behavior. We are only interested in one of them now - `M-0 M-e'
highlights the sexp for a fraction of a second insted of executing it.
Try it above.

Also:

  (insert \"HELLO\")

\[In this video we will also use `M-2 M-e' and `M-3 M-e' - they
create two-window settings with the \"target\" of the sexp in the
right window... but the idea of the \"target\" of a sexp only
makes sense when that sexp behaves as a hyperlink...]



3. Elisp hyperlinks
===================
Each one of the sexps below makes Emacs \"go somewhere\" if you execute
it with `M-e'. Executing sexps like those - we will call them \"elisp
hyperlinks\" - is like following a hyperlink in a browser.

In a browser you can \"go back\" after following a hyperlink because the
previous page is kept in the memory somehow. In Emacs+eev the easiest
way to \"go back\" is with `M-k', which runs a function called
`ee-kill-this-buffer'. If you follow one of the links below with
`M-e', it creates a new buffer and displays it. If you then type `M-k'
this new buffer is killed, and Emacs displays the buffer that was just
below it, which is this tutorial... try it! Here are some nice elisp
hyperlinks:

  (find-file  \"~/eev-current/eev-flash.el\")
  (find-fline \"~/eev-current/eev-flash.el\")

Not all elisp hyperlinks \"go somewhere\"; some are like buttons that
perform an action, like the one below, that acts as if the user had
pressed a series of keys,

  (eek \"<down> C-a H E L L O ! <up> C-e\")

and some display their output in the echo area:

  (find-sh0 \"date\")


Note: `find-fline' is a contraction of `find-file-line'...
`find-fline' is better for hyperlinks than `find-file' because it
can be \"refined\" to point to a precise place in a file. See:

  (find-refining-intro \"2. Refining hyperlinks\")

See also:

  (find-enode \"Major Modes\")

7.1. `eejump'
-------------
Some key sequences in Emacs accept numeric arguments. For
example, try typing `M-9 a' (not `M-9 M-a'!) - this will insert 9
copies of the letter `a'. See:

  (find-enode \"Arguments\")

Eev binds the key `M-j' (`eejump') to a function that jumps to a
place that depends on the numeric argument. For example, `M-5
M-j' runs (find-eev-quick-intro), that reloads this intro and
goes to the top of it, and

  `M-2 M-j' runs: (find-emacs-keys-intro)
  `M-6 M-j' runs: (find-escripts-intro)
  `M-1 M-j' runs: (find-fline \"~/TODO\")



7.2. The list of eejump targets
-------------------------------
If you type `M-j' without a prefix argument then it runs
`(find-eejumps)', that displays a help text followed by all the
current eejump targets as defuns, one in each line. Try it:

  (eek \"M-j\")
  (find-eejumps)

You will see that two of those entries are:

  (defun eejump-1 () (find-fline \"~/TODO\"))
  (defun eejump-5 () (find-eev-quick-intro))

The help text starts with:

  ;; (find-eejumps)
  ;; See: (find-eev-quick-intro \"7.1. `eejump'\")
  ;;      (find-emacs-keys-intro \"1. Basic keys (eev)\")
  ;; For example,
  ;;     M-1 M-j  runs:  (find-fline \"~/TODO\")
  ;;     M-2 M-j  runs:  (find-emacs-keys-intro)
  ;;     M-5 M-j  runs:  (find-eev-quick-intro)
  ;; Current eejump targets:

So if your mind goes blank and you forget everything except for
`M-j' and `M-e' you can just type `M-j' and follow one of the
elisp hyperlinks in the help text.




What are the next steps?
========================
Next steps:

  1) Learn e-script blocks:

      (find-eev-quick-intro \"6.1. The main key: <F8>\")
      (find-eev-quick-intro \"6.2. Other targets\" \"display all\")

  2) Learn how to use index-anchor pairs:

      (find-eev-quick-intro \"8.1. Introduction: `to'\")

  3) Learn how to write your executable notes and put them here:

      `M-1 M-j' runs: (find-fline \"~/TODO\")

Etc, etc, etc...
Note that learning to read comes after learning to write!...

  (find-here-links-intro \"1.1. Reading and writing\")

  What Lisp expressions can do:
  A mini tutorial
    Eduardo Ochs
    http://angg.twu.net/#eev
    http://angg.twu.net/#eev-screencasts
    (Version: 2019aug20)

  Everybody knows that Emacs is written in Lisp and that one of
  its main key sequences, `C-x C-e', executes the Lisp expression
  before the cursor and shows the result in the echo area... this
  can be used to calculate,

       (* 2 3)
               (* 4 5)
    (+ (* 2 3) (* 4 5))

  and can be used to call external programs - for examples, here
  he have some Lisp expressions that invoke a video player,

  (find-video \"~/eev-videos/Punch_and_Judy_Mark_Poulton-K6LmZ0A1s9U.mp4\")
  (code-video \"punchandjudyvideo\" \"~/eev-videos/Punch_and_Judy_Mark_Poulton-K6LmZ0A1s9U.mp4\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo)
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"0:00\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"0:10\" \"calls the baby\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"0:40\" \"where's the baby\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"1:04\" \"right position\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"1:17\" \"he will sing the baby to sleep\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"1:33\" \"1-2-3\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"1:48\" \"baby downstairs\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"3:12\" \"slaps\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"3:50\" \"1-2-3\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"4:34\" \"you keep an eye on mr Punch\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"4:46\" \"hat\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"5:03\" \"hat\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"5:25\" \"did you see him?\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"5:55\" \"clown\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"6:14\" \"slaps\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"6:52\" \"sausages\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"7:24\" \"crocodile\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"8:07\" \"crocodile + sausages\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"8:32\" \"another scene\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"8:39\" \"fight\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"9:03\" \"clown\")
  (find-punchandjudyvideo \"9:45\" \"mr punch\")

  and here we have some Lisp expressions that open a PDF at a
  given page:
