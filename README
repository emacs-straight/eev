Eev's central idea is that you can keep "executable logs" of what you
do, in a format that is reasonably readable and that is easy to "play
back" later, step by step and in any order. We call these "executable
logs" _e-scripts_. These "steps" are mainly of two kinds:

   1) elisp hyperlinks, and
   2) lines sent to shell-like programs.

To run the tutorial: install this package, then type `M-x
eev-beginner'. This will load all the main modules, activate the
eev-mode keybindings, and open this tutorial,

  (find-eev-quick-intro)

in a sandboxed buffer. For a list of the other sandboxed tutorials,
see:

  (find-eev-intro)

Note that the URLs point to the HTMLized versions of the sandboxed
tutorials, and the `(find-*-intro)' sexps open them in Emacs.

For a _non-technical_ description of what e-scripts are, see:

For an analysis of an e-script that uses most of the main features of
eev, see:

EEV WITHOUT EEV-MODE
====================
Eev mode only activates some keybindings and adds a reminder saying
"eev" to the mode line, as explained here:

  http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-intro.html#1
  (find-eev-intro "1. `eev-mode'")

It is possible to use eev's elisp hyperlink functions with eev-mode
turned off: just put the point on a line with an elisp hyperlink and
type `C-e C-x C-e'.

If you want to load all the main modules of eev to make its functions
available in this way, do:

  (require 'eev-load)

then you can use `M-x eev-mode' to toggle eev-mode on and off when
desired.
