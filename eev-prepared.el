This function is mostly used to send blocks of commands to shells via
a temporary script file. The shells do not receive the commands
immediately - we need to tell them to execute the commands stored in
the temporary script.\n
For example, if we mark the block below and type `M-x eev',\n
  # A hyperlink: (find-efunction 'eev)
  echo $[1+2]
  # Temporary scripts can change the
  # directory and the environment.
  cd /tmp/\n
and then go to a prepared shell and run `ee', we see something like
this:\n

  3
  # Temporary scripts can change the
  # directory and the environment.
  cd /tmp/
  /tmp$ \n
Note that this only works in \"prepared shells\", where `ee' has been
defined as a shell function in the correct way; the relevant code for
.bashrc or .zshrc is this:\n

  export EE        ;: ${EE:=$EEVTMPDIR/ee.sh}
