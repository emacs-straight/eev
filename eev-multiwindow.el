  "Create a multi-window setting according to CHARS and SEXPS.
A detailed explanation is here: (find-multiwindow-intro)

Here is a list of the standard characters that can be used in CHARS:
  1:  `delete-other-windows'       (C-x C-1)
  2:  `split-window-vertically'    (C-x C-2)
  3:  `split-window-horizontally'  (C-x C-3)
  s:  `split-window-sensibly'
  o:  `other-window'               (C-x o)
  +:  `balance-windows'            (C-x +)
  c:  `recenter'                   (C-l)
  _:  execute the next sexp in SEXPS.

To add support for a new character, say `C', just define
a function `find-wset-C'."
